"PRICED ABOVE MSRP. First thing first. These are Overpriced. This particular Nike Dri-Fit Training shirt has an MSRP of $22 (see picture of the tag from the green shirt for $22 and I paid $24 for it) and most of them listed here are going for $22-$30. That is ridiculous. You can go to Dicks Sporting Goods website and get them for $16.50. I ordered two of these shirts in red and green size XL for $23 and $24 respectively. The only reason I ordered these is because I thought they were the Dri-Fit Ts that normally retail for ~$35 and I thought I was getting a good deal. I have two of the $35 dri-fit t-shirts already, which fit really nice (not tight, I hate tight shirts, but not loose). These cheaper dri-fit t-shirts fit much larger than the $35 ones (see picture red $22 MSRP from amazon on left and navy $35 MSRP from Dicks on right, both XL). I am 63"", 230 lbs and the XL feels like I am wearing a dress.

I will be returning these shirts. I paid too much for what they actually are, and on top of that the fit is a little on the large size. There is no problem with the shirts quality wise, besides the larger fit. But if you do want one of these, do yourself a favor and dont order from here. Order it from Dicks for $16.50.",,,,,,,
"Fantastic product, the high quality stuff you expect from Nike.

Fits a tad large, but this is a performance shirt, so the idea behind it is to remove swear from the body and dry out. Dont expect this to hug at all, its meant to be a tad loose.

Awesome for warmer climates and situations where you gotta sweat but stay cool!",,,,,,,
Nice, comfortable shirt. I wear it playing tennis, jogging, boating, or just out running errands. It does seem to run a bit large, and long, but not so bad that I dont like it. I have several colors, and it is odd that they have such a wide range of prices. White was cheapest.
Im such a big fan of this running and workout shirt. It wicks moisture very well. I actually use it for hiking to keep my body cool, especially as a base layer during the spring or early fall.,,,,,,
The Nike Mens Legend shirt fit great for my son. He used it at summer camp as he was part of the purple cabin. He wore the shirt for all types of activities including game time, lunch/dinner, free time and various sporting events. The shirt did a great job wicking moisture away from his body and provided great protection from the elements. I would recommend this shirt as a great outdoor/indoor activity shirt.,,,,,
Nice fit and wears as advertised. Dri material retains slight smell after a few wears and washes. Does seem to go away after a deep soak and cleanse.,,,,,,,
Awesome and comfortable shirt! I wear when working out, playing tennis, and just around the house. Good price as well!,,,,,
This particular shirt came quite a bit larger than my other Medium Nike Dri-Fits. I noticed they were all made in different countries, so that might be the issue. Ill try and buy these shirts from local stores to make sure its the nice tight fit I was hoping for.,,,,,,
"Not yellow
It is a puke color and it was wadded up in the package
Don’t think it’s original nike",,,,,,,
Definitely great and authentic Nike quality, but a bit too large. Ordered a 2x, and its seriously huge.,,,,,
Quality is good but its extremely LARGE. Im 60 220pounds and the size large was dancing over my body,,,,,,,
Comfortable and fits well. I bought it late spring and have only worn it for a short run, but it breathed well. Would highly recommend it.,,,,,,
Purchased them for my daughter in law and she loves them. Very well made.,,,,,,,
fav longsleeve to work out it. i got the red/burgandy and always get compliments on the color,,,,,,,
Perfect Shirt, I love the high quality and it is very comfortable and light for the summer! I gave 4 stars because is a little large for me.,,,,,,
Great sports gear and my daughter loves them.,,,,,,,
It is an excellent product,,,,,,,
PERFECT ORANGE & FITS GREAT!,,,,,,,
Great looking casual shirt,,,,,,,
Very nice warm weather top for active sports.,,,,,,,
very thin fabric,,,,,,,
As noted, fit the person it was for great.,,,,,,
nice,,,,,,,
Just received the shirts and they fit as expected. Im very happy.,,,,,,,
XS is good fit but sleeves were too tight.,,,,,,,
I got this shirt today and I made the mistake to go by the size chart! Im 5ft 137lbs and according to the chart Im large but is way-way too big on me, Im returning this item.,,,,,,
I didnt realize this shirt was sheer. Super disappointed. I thought Id be able to wear it out for running errands & working out, but now I have to send it back.,,,,,,
Itchy... material not soft.,,,,,,,
Perfect for what I needed,,,,,,,
Cotton material, NOT dri-fit material. Not tight and I got an XS. Still a cute shirt but,,,,,,
Perfect,,,,,,,
I ordered a extra Large like all my others. This seems to run way small. Order up a size or two.,,,,,,,
I wear this every Monday Wednesday and Friday when I work on my upper body, it feels great! I love how it feels, I dont feel all nasty and wet and feel like my clothes is sticking to my body after Im done with my work out, not tight nice and loose, some people might not like it like that but I do, I recommend if you want it a little tight then get a size lower, I got the size I wear on my regular shirts and it was a little big but I like it like that.,
My husband loves these shirts!,,,,,,,
"The fit is good and I think for most people these would be perfect. I find I am always between sizes and this is no exception. My shoulders stick out a bit more than I would desire and the neck and arm holes are snug. I am 6 and weigh 175 43"" chest, 33"" waist so finding clothes is hard for me. Nonetheless these are high quality shirts that I will happily wear. They are a bit pricey for a sleeveless tee but they are Nike.",,,,,,,
"Fit was great, love the color, husband liked the ""muscle t"" look with the wider tank straps.",,,,,,,
super comfortable shirt,,,,,,,
Fits well and feels good,,,,,,,
Great shirt,,,,,,,
The shirt is fine but I got a medium and it is a little large. If you like your workout shirts a little looser than this is a good choice.,,,,,,,
I am very disappointed by the quality of this T shirt. It has a low quality material and does not compare to other Nike Dri-Fit clothing which we have bought in the past. After washing it once following the instructions it came out of the washer all fluffy with lots of lints on it (see the attached photo). I would not recommend buying it if you are looking for a good quality Dri-Fit T.,,,,,,,

This fits differently than my original Dri-Fit shirt, which I love. The shoulders are smaller, the material is different and a lighter weight (a little bit of see-through), and the torso is blousier. If you have broad or muscley shoulders, it will feel a bit tight. Overall weird fit for me.,,,
Seems to be cheaper material than Nikes other dry-fit shirts. A little long and loose around the waist, but I prefer that over being tight.,,,,,,
Will defiantly be replacing all my casual shirts with these in every color. Very nice material breaths well without being see through. Streatchy so very comfortable and perfect for outdoor activities and exercising drys quick exactly what it was supposed to do!,,,,,,,
I am a plus size after having a baby. I read the reviews of all those who said it ran large. I usually size up when buying online but due to those reviews I bought my usual size. This thing does not run big..,,,,,,,
The image is of a sports bra rather than of the black shirt I got for workouts.,,,,,,,
Fit really small but love the feel of the material wish it wouldve fit right,,,,,,,
"Great shirt for the gym. The M fit is somewhat loose, which I expected for the style.

Two stars because this shirt retails at $24.99 on the tag. Theyre selling at a premium.

My advice, wait until the price drops to at least $20 to get a better deal or run out to the nearest sporting goods store and buy one on sale at a retail store.",,,,,,,
I dont like to wear tight clothing when I run, but this was too big.,,,,,,
Excellent fit and the material dries fast. Great value and great design for workout or even casual wear.,,,,,,,
1.5 sizes too big but wearable. If wear a medium maybe opt for a small.,,,,,,,
Fit well and tighter than the Nike Womens Miler Short sleeve top,,,,,,,
Love this, its light weight and not clingy. I will be ordering again...,,,,,,
Comfy, however, little thick (warm) for summers,,,,,
This is more see through than the old dri-fit shirts. Its also on the large side. Im usually between a small and medium and I got the small but it was still a bit large after a few rounds in the dryer on high. Pretty color though and seems like its made well.,,,,,,,
"i dont know what happened but I bought 2 dry-fit T shirts size L (I have one M and it is a little tight thats why I bought L), but what I received wasnt what I expected. I had to give them to my husband and they fit them ok.
I am in argentina so I cant sned them back.
It was a waste of money.",,,,,,,
Niceeee nicceeee shirt,,,,,,,
Love Nike gear,,,,,,,
good quality,,,,,,,
Good shirt!,,,,,,,
Not even the same shirt that was shown! The purple is actually a dark pinkish color not a deep purple like what is in the images and description. It doesnt have the nike logo on the front and it has mesh on the back and sides. Not at all what was shown in the pictures.,,,,,,,
The color. Was not what the web site showed.,,,,,,,
Great Shirt,,,,,,,
Arrived quickly and great price!,,,,,,,
Ordered the Royal blue . Its much much brighter than the picture. Also ordered an XS and is still too big. Cannot wear it for this race.,,,,,,,
Nice color,,,,,,,
Nice color - if you are looking for a fitted look this is not the shirt - I wear a medium and its a little big - but the small would have been to small,,,,,,,
Wonderful shirt! Looks great and feels better. My daughter typically wears a womens small to med.so we hot small and its still loose,,,,,,,
Love this shirt!! I use it for my gym workouts, very comfortable and goes with everything.,,,,,,
Nice fit and very light,,,,,,,
It was larger than I expected. I should have ordered a small one for next time. But overall its comfortable for workout so Im happy with it.,,,,,,,
I received this shirt the day after I ordered it! And then ordered it in another color because of how perfect it is,,,,,,,
I love this material. When I work out and wear this shirt I dont feel like it weighs me down when I sweat,,,,,,,
Nothing like last years Legend Tee which fit better and I liked the material better.,,,,,,,
Great condition,,,,,,,
Fits great, nice material!,,,,,,
Its bit large but I like that for my jiu jitsu class.. Good buy and fast delivery,,,,,,,
very bad quality......the logo not white,its gray logo......its exist in local market by 3 usd,,,,,,
You can find a better product fot that price, too expensive and not that great,,,,,,
Very nice,,,,,,,
Excellent fit! Quality fabric. Love the color. Holds up to frequent washing and drying. Couldnt be happier.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt!,,,,,,,
Perfect cut. Not too tight but has a feminine, not boxy, cut. Love it.,,,,,
Color is not as shown, fit is loose.,,,,,,
Wish it was just a bit bigger in width. But it is just what I wanted for looks. Very comfortable. I have washed it and it did not shrink.,,,,,,,
Perfect, it was a gift, She loved it,,,,,
Color is it even close to what is pictured. Its is not a bright gold/yellow.. its a dull tan/pale gold color,,,,,,,
This shirt is the only shirt I use for exercising. I have five of them and love them. The fit is perfect.,,,,,,,
perfect fit,,,,,,,
It wasnt as nice as the one with the same name (DriFit) purchased in a store; its a very thin material.,,,,,,,
Clearly not a real small!,,,,,,,
Great fit, true to size,,,,,,
arrived in time for Christmas. Fit perfectly.,,,,,,,
Arrived on time and exactly as described.,,,,,,,
Thinner than some of my other Nike tops but a good length. I would buy again!,,,,,,,
Fits my wife perfectly. Looks great and keeps you cool on hot days!,,,,,,,
Grandaughter loves it !,,,,,,,
Great length and light weight. True to color,,,,,,,
The fit was as expected. Im very happy with this shirt. Its soft, thick enough to not see through and long enough so I can go through airport security and raise my arms without showing my stomach. I love it,,,,,,
Great t-shirt but runs small. Very fit cut,,,,,,,
good, but I had a mistake when I choose the size, it is too long, it covered my hip,,,,
This is not yellow. It is beige. I like the shirt but dont order unless you want beige.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt feels great,,,,,,,
Love it,,,,,,,
Runs a tiny bit large but fast shipping and exactly what I was looking for,,,,,,,
Runs long, but happy to have senior rear covered.,,,,,,
Fitted as expected! Keeps me cool during a workout,,,,,,,
What i wanted,,,,,,,
Love it,,,,,,,
"i hate this shirt. it is NOT like my other Nike crew neck dry fit shirt.
they obviously discountinued the one i like because i cant find it anywhere.
this is not a fitted shirt. i wear a small( in a fitted shirt) this one fits baggy and loose and long.",,,,,,,
Great material and comfort,,,,,,,
ok,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,
Love it!!,,,,,,,
Very cool garment; will enjoy wearing it!,,,,,,,
I LOVE IT!,,,,,,,
Love it! Easy handling when traveling.,,,,,,,
Excellent product , highly recommended.,,,,,,
This is a nice basic workout t-shirt. It keeps you dry, fit well and is comfortable.,,,,,,
Great fit.,,,,,,,
I didnt like the quality!,,,,,,,
Love this,,,,,,,
Fits comfortably,,,,,,,
Very confortable,,,,,,,
Great top for soccer.,,,,,,,
Ok a bit long...,,,,,,,
Super large neck line,,,,,,,
I bought this shirt thinking the size would run large as thats what many of the reviews said. I did not feel that way about this shirt. I did not like the way it fit me. I am pretty broad and chesty and this shirt was definitely unflattering. It is made for very slim and petite women, not for me. I returned it immediately.,,,,,,
Bought this for my older sister as a christimas present. She loves it so much and commonly gets compliments on it! I plan on getting her a few more next christmas.,,,,,,,
Good as expected.,,,,,,,
Great feeling, rapids drying shirts. Planning a motorcycle trip and taking along a few of these. Rinse out at night and let hand dry.,,,,,,
Great fit, super comfortable, warm, but doesnt make you sweat. Its a perfect workout shirt or great for wearing under a jersey.,,,,
"I enjoy this shirt, as it works for what I intended it for. It was a little bigger than expected, bigger than many other ""Large"" shirts I have but not overly large. Its just a bit loose and a little thin, thats all. Works great though, as I use it as an undershirt in layering for the upper Midwest winters, as it can be quite cold up here. Comfortable, but it should be a bit cheaper, like $20 would be more acceptable. My main gripe is that Nike is really pushing it selling it for about $30 (for just a plain white t-shirt!) just because they can.",,,,,,,
This shirt is very nice, I bought the green one for my husband. The material is thinner but it falls and fits very nice, it does not cling. I highly recommend this shirt.,,,,,
These teet-shirts fit the way I wanted them to, for the size I thought. I have no problem ordering the way I had , thank you.,,,,,
Nice lightweight shirt. Great for working out, or wearing in the sun when you need extra coverage, but want to stay cool.,,,,,
some what too large but good quality sleeves a little too long also good quality so i gave it 3 stars no i would not buy again,,,,,,,
Great training shirt. Dont expect these to keep you warm as they are pretty thin, however they are very nice and soft and looks great. Its a somewhat fitted shirt, so make sure you dont have a tummy or it will show lol.,,,,,
My husband loves this Tee. He washes it in woolite and hang to dry. Last a long time!,,,,,,,
Comfortable, but like any other white workout shirt, will stain with sunscreen.,,,,,
My significant other was very happy with the material of this shirt and it fit perfect,,,,,,,
The sizes run smaller than most, had to return it. Sorry to say they didnt have same in larger sizes.,,,,,,
Excellent quality and price. Fit perfectly. My husband love it.,,,,,,,
Cheap quality with thin material. Not happy with what I got for the price.,,,,,,,
Warm yet cool, looks fresh and feels great. No issues, fits well.,,,,,
Needed a purple shirt. This was a great choice.,,,,,,,
Great Fit! Perfect Wash and Wear!!,,,,,,,
Son loves it. He looks good in it,,,,,,,
Great product, great seller!!!,,,,,,
Im slightly disappointed because the image I viewed appeared that the product faded from a washed out purple to a saturated purple below the shoulders. I referenced the same image while writing this review and have determined that flood lighting is creating a washed out effect on the promotional image. I used the item as a wind breaker over a sweat shirt for a team event that required a purple shirt. I will normally use it as a winter running shirt.,,,,,,,
too big not matter what size,,,,,,,
love the design and fit,,,,,,,
A little bit longer on sleeves than hope for but all in all great!,,,,,,,
nice shirt, comfy and well made,,,,,,
Looks great and fits well,,,,,,,
a gift and was loved,,,,,,,
Another satisfied customer,,,,,,,
Fits great. Extra coverage to keep the sun off during the long runs. Easy clean. Love it!,,,,,,,
Got it for our son-in-law for Christmas - he loved it and has worn it several times!,,,,,,,
Great color and size is a good fit. Happy with purchase.,,,,,,,
Fantastic product. Im absolutely in love with Nike Dri-Fit products,,,,,,,
I got this shirt as a gift for my boyfriend and he really likes it. It fits as expected and he likes that its light on him while he runs. Very timely shipping!,,,,,,,
I purchased one of these in hope of finding something that is light enough to wear and use at the gym, but still thick enough to where my nips wouldnt be popping out the whole time. Im pleased with the buy. The quality is great. Im 511 and weigh about 165-70. I went with a large and am happy i did so. Wear a tank top underneath though. If your gym is cold your nips mighy show.,,,,,,
Very good quality. Great value.,,,,,,,
Fits nice and feels good.,,,,,,,
Comfy,,,,,,,
Excellent product, price and shipping,,,,,,
Fits perfect,,,,,,,
Nice shirt. I have one in gray and now this one in white. I like the fit, i.e., not baggy, and the thinness of the fabric. Other brands are thicker, and I find that makes me too hot while exercising. Also great to wear in the sun.,,,
Bought this for my son and he loves it! Fits as expected!,,,,,,,
This is made in Mexico. The Vietnam fabric is much better.,,,,,,,
I liked this Nike long sleeve a lot.,,,,,,,
Too large,,,,,,,
Great,,,,,,,
I got the large. It looks great, however really is....welll.... quite large. I am 6 feet tall, around 200 pounds with a relatively athletic physique and this is still quite a bit too big on me. Feels more like an extra large. Insanely comfortable though and it still looks great. I would just size down if at all possible.,,,,,
I bought this shirt for longer runs (10+ miles) here in Central Florida on days when it is typically over 90 degrees and over 90% humidity. It definitely makes a difference with the white color as it is highly reflective and keeps you cooler in that regard. Secondly, you are now evaporating sweat from both your skin and the shirt, creating a better core temp cooling mechanism. I recommend.,,,,,
Super super comfortable an awesome looking but the only problem is when you order a large it comes in a slightly smaller size so its not Amazons fault, but rather Nikes for making a shirt and not giving it the proper size but overall still a great purchase and a goal to work towards,,,,,,
The long sleeves feels good but the size are a little bigger then what I ordered. I wear a medium but when I put this on, it feels and look a little bigger then medium but a little smaller then a large.,,,,,,
"Great breathable and ultra-light running shirt! The fit for the M is spot on for someone bw around 510 - 62"", with decent chest room (ie not too snug)",,,,,,,
"Comfortable dry-fit long sleeve t-shirt.
Fits well on medium frame-size.
Made in Jordan.",,,,,,,
great for the gym!,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,
Ive bought several of these. Their great to work out in or to lounge around in.,,,,,,,
bought this for a co-worker for secret santa. bought him a medium but it fits like a large. He still uses it though :) shipped and delivered on time,,,,,,,
"This was ordered for my very thin grandson. He usually wears a mens small, but this was still a bit loose in the small, but he still likes it.
",,,,,,,
100f outside and this long sleeve is keeping me cool, love thus shirt buying more,,,,,,
Fits well like to wear to the gym with my Nike Mens Free Trainer 3.0 V3 Training Shoe [Color: Game Royal/White] its a perfect match. When you running keeps the sweat under control. This way when you leave the gym you arent exposed to the cold air. I have few brands of shirts, but actually find these the most comfortable.,,,,,,
Just as you would expect. But smaller than most. Would get the next size up,,,,,,,
"Nice fit
not see through own two",,,,,,,
shirt feels very good on skin. keeps you cool and fits as expected,,,,,,,
I would recommend. Love the fit and color. No surprises here.,,,,,,,
Very good shirt made with nice expensive looking material. The shirt fits very well. I purchased the purple because most of the other colors were sold out in large. I was skeptical of the color because its purple. However, the shirt looks really good on.,,,,,,
Bought it for a Christmas gift & they loved it,,,,,,,
great shirt - fits accordingly and looks great - highly recommend,,,,,,,
"I ordered size M, its a little tight around chest, sending it back.

The material is dri-fit, very thin, but durable, not too bad for $32 I paid.",,,,,,,
A little oversized, decent quality.,,,,,,
I love this ! I would buy more!,,,,,,,
Nice color and fit,,,,,,,
Came in as red and not maroon my boyfriend ended up keeping it but now he has two of the same color,,,,,,,
Dont typically buy clothing from Amazon, but my husband has a NIKE Black long sleeve crew and wanted a white one. The size is accurate.,,,,,,
The outside tag said Large but when tried on realized it was very tight. The inside tag showed it was a small.,,,,,,,
exelent,,,,,,,
some of these run so small like they are meant for undershirts or workout only but this is a good shirt for relaxing or casual wear no form fitting,,,,,,,
I bought this lightweight dry fit for my husband to wear to the gym. He loves it. It provides extra warmth under his t shirt because our gym is always freezing cold. I bought a medium, he weighs about 165 and is 5 10 and it fits true to size.,,,,,,
great!!!,,,,,,,
Got for my father-in-law for Christmas, who usually wears a Tall, and it fit very well. He loved it so much he wore it two days in a row! LOL!,,,,,
Nice Shirt.,,,,,,,
Great fit and quality, exactly what I needed,,,,,,
Fits well throughout chest and back etc. Was expecting more of a tight fit through the arms however and wrists, however. All in all a great shirt though.,,,,,,
Great purchase. Im 62 200 pounds and ordered a large. The shirt fits great and came MUCH faster than the ETA,,,,,,,
The upper part of the sleeves are oddly baggy, while the lower forearm fits as expected. My husband isnt really a fan of it, but I think I will try to alter it so the upper arms fit more like they should.,,,,,
Great shirt for the price....Very comfortable!,,,,,,,
I was very disappointed. It was thinner and more see-through than the picture depicted. I will just use it as an undershirt on a cold day.,,,,,,,
Arrived on time and looks okay - not really impressed with the material and it had a weird smell to it when it first arrived.,,,,,,,
you can buy it at the same price outside.,,,,,,,
I bought two of these and love them. Loose fitting and lightweight. Perfect for working, hiking/camping, or just lounging around the house.,,,,,
Fits beautifully,,,,,,,
Love this shirt. Excellent for working out in or just casual wear.,,,,,,,
I have three of these all different colors. Ordered them from the same place. Fast shipping! Will buy a few more in different colors soon.,,,,,,,
"A gift for my hubby, He is 511"" 173lbs, I got him size L. It fits well.",,,,,,,
Bought it for my husband, looks And fits great,,,,,,
It was perfect just what my grandson wanted. The fit was just right, the purple was a beautiful color. Very pleased.,,,,,,
Perfect fit, great for running.,,,,,,
For some reason this fabric snags very easily on velcro. (the hook side). I have a dozen of these NikeFit that I bought years ago that dont do that.,,,,,,,
Bit larger than description.,,,,,,,
These are sized a little bigger than you would think or are used too. But the quality is still the NIKE quality. I would easy buy again.,,,,,,,
An excellent & interesting transaction,,,,,,,
Dri-Fit T-shirts are a great idea. I wear it when I play tennis in the sun to keep the sun off of my arms. It is great!,,,,,,,
I really love this as a long sleeve under shirt, under my golf polo shirts. Or can be worn as an outer shirt, its not very heavy, very light breathable material,,,,
"Great fit , exactly as described, fast delivery
I would order from this seller again",,,,,,,
My husband loves these shirts for running in the winter. Bought as a Christmas present.,,,,,,,
"I bought this t-shirt for my daughters boy friend he loved it.
Beautiful blue",,,,,,,
My husband really likes these shirts and this one is one of his favorites. Its thin enough to wear underneath a sweatshirt/fleece or to layer over a tshirt. Dri-fit material.,,,,,,,
It is great and my nephew loved it, the material was comfortable and the fit was good,,,,,,
Bought as a gift for my brother - he loves it! Stated is was comfortable and washed great. He is tall and has broad shoulders - fit great all the way around.,,,,,,,
Perfect shirt if you are running outdoors in the winter or late fall. It fits loose and is very comfortable! I would definitely reccommend this product.,,,,,,,
Great shirt, cool, nice material. Fits a littler big but is great for exercising when it is not that hot out.,,,,,
I rock one of these in a different color at least 5 days a week. Theyre legit af,,,,,,,
Arms are a bit tight where they attach to the body. Otherwise fits as expected.,,,,,,,
All perfect, thanks!!!!,,,,,,
Was not what i expected, please be careful of what the item description says and what your expectations are.,,,,,,
??,,,,,,,
Slow ship but worth the wait.,,,,,,,
I am somewhat dissapointed with how dark the color of the shirt is .,,,,,,,
Great long sleeve running shirt. Ive owned these before so no big surprise.,,,,,,,
Nike is still the best dry fit weave available, Ive bought adidas and others but they can be scratchy.,,,,,,
This shirt will get you hella chicks,,,,,,,
Too thin !Long sleeves!,,,,,,,
Fits perfectly and material is light for late spring/early fall weather in the mid-west.,,,,,,,
You get what you pay for. Very thin, badly fitting shirt,,,,,,
Fits good, but this is way light weight. In fact you can see right thought this shirt? For the price I thought it would be higher quality Nike.,,,,,,
Nice quality and good finishing as well. If you have an athletic body type this would look perfect. I use these for gym and dont feel sweaty.,,,,,,,
Bought a medium; small would probably be the right fit,,,,,,,
Fits just as expected. Im very happy with my purchase,,,,,,,
Great color,though i wish the swoosh was embroidered..,,,,,,
Ive bought several of these & they are a good look & so comfortable!,,,,,,,
"It isnt made of the same material as the ""Nike Dri-fit"". The item is also too small.
Not happy with this purchase.",,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
I was skeptical, but believe all the other reviewers now- this runs really a size or size and a half big. I usually wear a L, but this was the biggest, longest M Ive ever seen!,,,,
Fits perfectly. Feels great in the heat considering I walk all day as a letter carrier.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt, fits very good. Like the fabric. Will be good sun protection without being too hot.,,,,,,
I like the color, the fit, the weight (perfect for coolish summer days).,,,,,
Loved it!,,,,,,,
Awesome shirt and fits as expected..,,,,,,,
Loose sleeves exactly what I wanted for bug protection.,,,,,,,
Fits slightly bigger than expected, but great product. Exactly what I was looking for!,,,,,,
Light and dry feel.,,,,,,,
My husband likes this shirt a lot,,,,,,,
The material is strange. Tends to hold body odor and doesnt breathe well. Not liking it so far,,,,,,,
Grandson was very proud of it.,,,,,,,
great fit, just what i wanted,,,,,,
very nice fit true to sizing,,,,,,,
Shirt fits loosely, but is true to size.,,,,,,
Shirt was the perfect gift.,,,,,,,
Good shirt but doesnt fit as expected.,,,,,,,

Bought this as a gift for a friend at the gym. He loved it and it fits him great.,,,,,,,
very comfortable shirt.,,,,,,,
Great shirt. Love it!,,,,,,,
Its a nice shirt, but it was for my 13 year old son and it almost fits my husband who wears a large.,,,,,,
it is not cotton , it looks like the football Tshirt in its material ,,,,,,
Good quality material,,,,,,,

Very good Dri-Fit long sleeve shirt for running in cool weather.,,,,,,,
Absolutely Perfect!!,,,,,,,
Good quality...good fit.....nice material for a trip as it is easy to clean,,,,,,,
great shirt, very comfortable and form fitting,,,,,,
These shirts are great for working out. Keeps you dry and very comfortable. I have used them for hiking in cold weather as well as an undershirt to wick sweat away.,,,,,,,
Item as described,,,,,,,
Awesome like all things Nike. The only thing is the neck line runs a little loose for my liking. A thicker seam on the neckline would make this shirt perfect.,,,,,,,
Shirt fit as expected and was the exact shade of red I wanted.,,,,,,,
Fits well, easy to wrestle in and work out in,,,,,,

Great fit; light weight .Perfect to work out in which was just what he wanted.,,,,,,,
This shirt is great for warming up, light workouts, or running outside/on the treadmill. It fits really well, and is thin so it is very breathable.,,,,
Extraordinarily thin material. Maybe thats the way it is supposed to be.,,,,,,,
Very good,,,,,,,

#swag,,,,,,,

It fit well.,,,,,,,
Fast shipping. Exactly what i wanted,,,,,,,
Shirt fits very well, is very soft and comfortable. I ordered a few more in other colors. Good for exercising.,,,,,,
as expected,,,,,,,
fits great,,,,,,,
Ordered a size small...it was huge...and I am 5.10 and 150 LBs...,,,,,,,
Love these Nike Dri-Fit crew tops. Long sleeve or short sleeve they make for great casual shirts or workout shirts. Theyre breathable, durable, and fashionable. The heather grey color is my favorite. I bought this one to replace the one I let my friend borrow(which he has yet to return). Great product!,,,,,
My son wanted to purchase this. While I felt it was a bit overpriced, he was very happy with it. The material is very breathable.,,,,,,
Bought it for my husband. He loves these dry-fit tees and wanted this color. He was somewhat disappointed because it fit him larger than the other long sleeve dry-fit Nike tees that he has bought in the past. For future buyers, I recommend buying a size smaller.,,,,,,
Fit perfect - large as expected. Great material that dries quick.,,,,,,,
is bad,,,,,,,
I use this for golf when I go to practice and occasionally play. Feels great in Texas summers at 100+ degree heat. Usually a concern for me is how see threw the white is but I have not had that problem with this product! Am going to buy more and get a polo version as well,,,,,,,
This is a nice product, but the arms are very long compared with the body. If you need a shirt for a bigger body, but dont have particularly long arms, you may want to look at other similar products.,,,,
It doesnt feel like a Nike product. Looks like a cheap rip off.,,,,,,,
Solid shirt. I got this item for the gym but I also wear it when Im not in the gym. It is light so it is very breathable. I have a few short sleeve versions of this shirt but I think Ill be getting more of these in the future.,,,,,,,
"Really like the shirt but it definitely runs large. I am 62"" and the sleeves are long and the neck opening is larger than I would like. Really wish I had ordered a size smaller but stuck with an expensive t-shirt.",,,,,,,
Fit perfectly,,,,,,,
Very nice fit, color very true to picture and size was very accurate, my husband loved it,,,,,
The only problem I have is that I paid 30 dollars for a 28 dollar shirt. Thats what it said on the tag !! I should have looked further for a better deal !!,,,,,,,
I would advise anyone purchasing to order a size down. I ordered a medium and it looks like a large plus its a very loose material so that makes it even bigger fitting.,,,,,,,
My husband really likes this shirt however it swallows him. And the sleeves are long. Still giving 4 stars because for someone that it fits it would be perfect.,,,,,,,
This is a nice shirt for working out or casual wear. It is really thin material so can be worn in summer too. It fits nice, not super tight but like a t-shirt.,,,,,,
The shirt arrived quickly, and his extremely comfortable. I recommend this product for anyone that is interested in being comfortable while working out.,,,,,,
Everything arrived on time and in good condition. Great product for working out - exactly what I was hoping for / expected. Happy with my purchase,,,,,,,
He said its light weight very comfortable. As for me the wash, Can wear right out of dryer and its looks brand new. I bought all colors for him.,,,,,,
"The material is cheap. Not what I expected from reading the reviews. Ive bought actual Nike ""dri-fit"" from Nike and those were actually very durable and warm. This material is very thin. If you want it just for looks for the gym, I guess its ok but for its purpose -dont buy",,,,,,,
It doesnt seem authentic. It was huge. Small fit like a large. Material isnt similar to Nikes shirts.,,,,,,,
To large for me,,,,,,,
I ordered an XL and I received an XL Tall. Does not fit well at all. Product is not as described.,,,,,,,
Great it is exactly what I ordered.....great product and great price, would order more of these in the future for sure,,,,,,
The shirt was a little too big but I still use it. It works great and worth the price I paid.,,,,,,,
Excellent quality. My grandson loved it and it looked great on him. Very pleased.,,,,,,,
S Size was a bit large and wide for me in the sleeves, but still being a good product!,,,,,,
this product is very good, apart from their arrival shipping services consider them the best,,,,,,
Good fit and so far good quality to resistance to wear and tear,,,,,,,
No comment,,,,,,,
Nice Long Sleeve!,,,,,,,
great product snd customer service,,,,,,,
Its ok,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
Dont buy it. When i saw this first time in my eyes, i couldnt believe my eyes. I ordered T-shirt not dress. So I measured this stupid long bodied T-shirt, it was 29.5 inches. How can man have a body lengths of 29.5 inches? Besides the fact that i am Asian, this T-shirt is way too long.,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
I was expecting more of an under armor type of shirt. you know, tightly fit on the sleeves to show off biceps.? A bit loose on the arms and short in length of the entire shirt. fits kind of awkward for my taste. Good material though.,,,,,,
I hate the fit as that the large fits like a normal x-large. Something was wrong with the sizing.,,,,,,,
About 100% sure this shirt isnt a real Nike Dri-Fit. I own about 4 different Dri-fits and this one is counterfeit. The Nike swoosh looks and feels fake, the fabric doesnt feel like a Dri fit.,,,,,,
Excelente. Continuaré comprando a este vendedor. Tienda recomendada para hacer más compras internacionales. GRACIAS POR LA VENTA DEL PRODUCTO. SALUDOS,,,,,,,
Comfy sweater especially for work in the spring and fall,,,,,,,
I initially ordered a couple of these Nike long sleeve shirts in a couple of colors to check out the quality of the material and the workmanship. Some people had posted that the shirts were too sheer and too light for their use. All I can say is that these shirts are my new faves for working out and for wearing under quarter zip pullover shirts. I think I have ordered a total of six or seven of these shirts in various colors and I was actually contemplating ordering a few more when amazon sent an email message asking me to post a review on these shirts. The shirts are generously sized. The material is high quality and is very comfortable next to my skin, unlike some of my other long sleeve work out shirts. The workmanship is excellent. They come in a wide variety of colors. And, they are only +/- $25.00 each. Believe me, you will not be disappointed. These shirts are a great value. Enjoy... and just do it !!,,,,
This dri fit shirt is made of very very thin/fine fabric. It completely takes to the shape of your body. So unless youve got a banging body this might not be the shirt for you. The other dri fit materials are made of a hardier fabric that can kind of keep their shape. I didnt like this one because of the fit. But if youre a runner looking for a next to naked feeling dri fit shirt, this might be the shirt for you.,,,,,,
Nice shirt. I normally wear an x-lg t-shirt, so I got this in an x-lg as well, but I wish I had opted for a large. This kind of shirt wasnt meant to be this loose. My fault, though, so Im still giving it 5-stars. I guess Ill get another, but in large, and Ill just wear this one while doing yard-work or something. Id recommend you guys to consider getting a size smaller than usual.,
"Found my new favorite shirt(s) can wear it for a run or out to eat and very comfortable. Fits good 5""10 165 lbs size large (maybe a tad loose but not bad) very thin though. Nike makes a version 2.0 to this shirt that has some cotton rather than 100% poly that I like better but still love this shirt.",,,,,,,
"really low quality material for this shirt I was expecting something way better for the price and the Nike brand although Im doubting if its actually legit. The Nike logo isnt reflective neither the ""Dri-Fit"" something I found weird because if you look closely to the other shirts they say NikeFit. My chest is quite visble with this tshirt something that Im not a fan though and I used and sweated it and it doesnt dry as my other Nike or whatever other sport brand tshirt. Sadly Im not in the US otherwise Id ask for a refund.

This review isnt biased. Nobody is paying to talk about the crappy product I bought is just a customers opinion about a con over a ""Nike"" shirt. Sad

Here are some pictures of the product.",,,,,,,
"I bought this shirt b/c I wanted a long sleeve shirt to wear around the house that wasnt too warm. This works perfectly. Its light, cool, and extremely comfortable.

Regarding the size, Im 60 and weight 230. I tend to buy XXL size shirts, but on the suggestion of other reviews, I ordered an XL. The fit is perfect, which is to say that any purchasers should also consider ordering a size smaller than normal.",,,,,,,
"The fabric is thin but nice, its overall a good looking shirt, but I have to return it since it was far too large. I normally order medium (I am 5 10.5), but I ordered small (which is the smallest size available) based on the reviews. Both the shirt and the sleeves are about 1 longer than the maximum that I would tolerate. There is also a lot of extra fabric under the armpits and the shirt fits pretty loosely, so I would just order 1-2 sizes smaller if that was possible. The shirt label says ""S"", so I was sent the correct size.",,,,,,,
Very cheap shirt, not like the photo what so ever. Im not sure why so much good reviews but its the only reason I thought i was getting a nice shirt which is cheap looking shirt, the only reason for the two starts is the super fast shipping!! Not worth the money! Believe me....,,,,,
"Great shirt. Love the material and feel. I usually get a large, but purchased med because of reviews. Fits good but I like shirts to be a little more loose. Going to order a couple more but large this time. Im 510, 180.

11-16-15 I ordered 2 more. I am LE and wear under my uniform. Hold up well and very comfortable.",,,,,,,
"I bought these shirts in 2014 and my initial response to these shirts was they were fantastic. All the seams l lie flat inside and out. Fit was good felt great on so long as I only wore them short term. So for fit and quality of manufacture they would get 5 stars, but this is 2016 and I believe there are some other considerations and technologies that should be added to this type of shirt. I used these shirts as I worked maintenance for a condo and later as a pest control technician.

Having anti-odor/Anti-microbial technology made into the shirt didnt seem that important when I bought these items. However, it has to be if you need to wear a shirt made with this type of fabric longer than a few hours. When I wore these shirts under my short sleeve work shirt they became foul smelling on long hot days. I thought it might be me forgetting deodorant or something, I even carried a spare stick in my truck. After I switched to another brand with anti-odor/Anti-microbial properties I didnt have the odor issues I had with the Nike Dry Fit. So this consideration is rated by me a critical fail.

Additionally these are not advertised as having any sun protection capability, another component I need here in NW Florida. I now wear this type of shirt to play tennis to try to stay cool in the summer and get some protection from the sun to make my dermatologist happy. I want to avoid sunscreen so it doesnt mess up my grip on the racquet. After wearing these shirts for nearly a year my dermatologist treated and area in the middle of my back. Hence my renewed interest in UPF shirts. Again this area is rated by me as a critical fail.

Bottom Line: Just dont, I have to replace these Nike Dry Fit shirts to get the anti-odor/Anti-microbial and UPF 50 capabilities available in other shirts so I wasted my money on Nike. Im trying the Vapor Apparel Mens UPF Long Sleeve Solar Performance T-Shirt as a replacement.",,,,,,,
The Nike Mens Legend Poly Long Sleeve Dri-Fit T-shirt arrived within the scheduled time frame and was exactly as described on the site. It fits well, is very comfortable and I would recommend it to anyone that either works out or, wants to wear it as a long sleeved shirt under a short sleeved shirt.,,,,,
The sleeves are so long. Im 60. 165lbs. I wear an XL. The sleeves hang past my hands about 3-4 inches.,,,,,,,
"I bought this shirt from another site since it was a lot cheaper.

The shirt definitely runs large. Im 510"", 170 lbs, and usually wear mediums for Nike shirts, and they arent too loose on me. I bought a small of this shirt and it fits me very well, you could maybe even say its a little baggy, which is fine with me.

The shirt is thin, made to wear in the summer or for workouts, not the best to keep warm.

However, the shirt is very comfortable and its not too thin that you can see through it.",,,,,,,
This is a nice quality shirt, especially if you order the right size. I ordered it for my husband who is small in stature. He is 5ft. 7 and 150 pounds. I ordered a medium and it fits him very well. He loved the shirt so much that I ordered another one in Maroon. Unfortunately, they sent me the red which is why I only gave four stars as opposed to five. The only reason why I didnt send it back is because my husband decided to go ahead and keep the red even though that is not the color I wanted.,,,,,
Very nice fit and feel.Well made. Its a kind of a semi-mesh fabric that looks to be breathable. Would buy another one anytime soon. Im pleased with my purchase.,,,,,,,
"The picture of the product shows a Nike check.
Be aware the shirt may not have a Nike check.
As seen below, mine did not.",,,,,,,
"PRICED ABOVE MSRP. First thing first. These are Overpriced. This particular Nike Dri-Fit Training shirt has an MSRP of $22 (see picture of the tag from the green shirt for $22 and I paid $24 for it) and most of them listed here are going for $22-$30. That is ridiculous. You can go to Dicks Sporting Goods website and get them for $16.50. I ordered two of these shirts in red and green size XL for $23 and $24 respectively. The only reason I ordered these is because I thought they were the Dri-Fit Ts that normally retail for ~$35 and I thought I was getting a good deal. I have two of the $35 dri-fit t-shirts already, which fit really nice (not tight, I hate tight shirts, but not loose). These cheaper dri-fit t-shirts fit much larger than the $35 ones (see picture red $22 MSRP from amazon on left and navy $35 MSRP from Dicks on right, both XL). I am 63"", 230 lbs and the XL feels like I am wearing a dress.

I will be returning these shirts. I paid too much for what they actually are, and on top of that the fit is a little on the large size. There is no problem with the shirts quality wise, besides the larger fit. But if you do want one of these, do yourself a favor and dont order from here. Order it from Dicks for $16.50.",,,,,,,
"Fantastic product, the high quality stuff you expect from Nike.

Fits a tad large, but this is a performance shirt, so the idea behind it is to remove swear from the body and dry out. Dont expect this to hug at all, its meant to be a tad loose.

Awesome for warmer climates and situations where you gotta sweat but stay cool!",,,,,,,

Nice, comfortable shirt. I wear it playing tennis, jogging, boating, or just out running errands. It does seem to run a bit large, and long, but not so bad that I dont like it. I have several colors, and it is odd that they have such a wide range of prices. White was cheapest.
Im such a big fan of this running and workout shirt. It wicks moisture very well. I actually use it for hiking to keep my body cool, especially as a base layer during the spring or early fall.,,,,,,
The Nike Mens Legend shirt fit great for my son. He used it at summer camp as he was part of the purple cabin. He wore the shirt for all types of activities including game time, lunch/dinner, free time and various sporting events. The shirt did a great job wicking moisture away from his body and provided great protection from the elements. I would recommend this shirt as a great outdoor/indoor activity shirt.,,,,,
Nice fit and wears as advertised. Dri material retains slight smell after a few wears and washes. Does seem to go away after a deep soak and cleanse.,,,,,,,
Awesome and comfortable shirt! I wear when working out, playing tennis, and just around the house. Good price as well!,,,,,
This particular shirt came quite a bit larger than my other Medium Nike Dri-Fits. I noticed they were all made in different countries, so that might be the issue. Ill try and buy these shirts from local stores to make sure its the nice tight fit I was hoping for.,,,,,,
"Not yellow
It is a puke color and it was wadded up in the package
Don’t think it’s original nike",,,,,,,
Definitely great and authentic Nike quality, but a bit too large. Ordered a 2x, and its seriously huge.,,,,,
Quality is good but its extremely LARGE. Im 60 220pounds and the size large was dancing over my body,,,,,,,
Comfortable and fits well. I bought it late spring and have only worn it for a short run, but it breathed well. Would highly recommend it.,,,,,,
Purchased them for my daughter in law and she loves them. Very well made.,,,,,,,
fav longsleeve to work out it. i got the red/burgandy and always get compliments on the color,,,,,,,
Perfect Shirt, I love the high quality and it is very comfortable and light for the summer! I gave 4 stars because is a little large for me.,,,,,,
Great sports gear and my daughter loves them.,,,,,,,
It is an excellent product,,,,,,,
PERFECT ORANGE & FITS GREAT!,,,,,,,
Great looking casual shirt,,,,,,,
Very nice warm weather top for active sports.,,,,,,,
very thin fabric,,,,,,,
As noted, fit the person it was for great.,,,,,,
nice,,,,,,,
Just received the shirts and they fit as expected. Im very happy.,,,,,,,
XS is good fit but sleeves were too tight.,,,,,,,
I got this shirt today and I made the mistake to go by the size chart! Im 5ft 137lbs and according to the chart Im large but is way-way too big on me, Im returning this item.,,,,,,
I didnt realize this shirt was sheer. Super disappointed. I thought Id be able to wear it out for running errands & working out, but now I have to send it back.,,,,,,
Itchy... material not soft.,,,,,,,
Perfect for what I needed,,,,,,,
Cotton material, NOT dri-fit material. Not tight and I got an XS. Still a cute shirt but,,,,,,
Perfect,,,,,,,
I ordered a extra Large like all my others. This seems to run way small. Order up a size or two.,,,,,,,
I wear this every Monday Wednesday and Friday when I work on my upper body, it feels great! I love how it feels, I dont feel all nasty and wet and feel like my clothes is sticking to my body after Im done with my work out, not tight nice and loose, some people might not like it like that but I do, I recommend if you want it a little tight then get a size lower, I got the size I wear on my regular shirts and it was a little big but I like it like that.,
My husband loves these shirts!,,,,,,,
"The fit is good and I think for most people these would be perfect. I find I am always between sizes and this is no exception. My shoulders stick out a bit more than I would desire and the neck and arm holes are snug. I am 6 and weigh 175 43"" chest, 33"" waist so finding clothes is hard for me. Nonetheless these are high quality shirts that I will happily wear. They are a bit pricey for a sleeveless tee but they are Nike.",,,,,,,
"Fit was great, love the color, husband liked the ""muscle t"" look with the wider tank straps.",,,,,,,
super comfortable shirt,,,,,,,
Fits well and feels good,,,,,,,
Great shirt,,,,,,,
The shirt is fine but I got a medium and it is a little large. If you like your workout shirts a little looser than this is a good choice.,,,,,,,
I am very disappointed by the quality of this T shirt. It has a low quality material and does not compare to other Nike Dri-Fit clothing which we have bought in the past. After washing it once following the instructions it came out of the washer all fluffy with lots of lints on it (see the attached photo). I would not recommend buying it if you are looking for a good quality Dri-Fit T.,,,,,,,

This fits differently than my original Dri-Fit shirt, which I love. The shoulders are smaller, the material is different and a lighter weight (a little bit of see-through), and the torso is blousier. If you have broad or muscley shoulders, it will feel a bit tight. Overall weird fit for me.,,,
Seems to be cheaper material than Nikes other dry-fit shirts. A little long and loose around the waist, but I prefer that over being tight.,,,,,,
Will defiantly be replacing all my casual shirts with these in every color. Very nice material breaths well without being see through. Streatchy so very comfortable and perfect for outdoor activities and exercising drys quick exactly what it was supposed to do!,,,,,,,
I am a plus size after having a baby. I read the reviews of all those who said it ran large. I usually size up when buying online but due to those reviews I bought my usual size. This thing does not run big..,,,,,,,
The image is of a sports bra rather than of the black shirt I got for workouts.,,,,,,,
Fit really small but love the feel of the material wish it wouldve fit right,,,,,,,
"Great shirt for the gym. The M fit is somewhat loose, which I expected for the style.

Two stars because this shirt retails at $24.99 on the tag. Theyre selling at a premium.

My advice, wait until the price drops to at least $20 to get a better deal or run out to the nearest sporting goods store and buy one on sale at a retail store.",,,,,,,
I dont like to wear tight clothing when I run, but this was too big.,,,,,,
Excellent fit and the material dries fast. Great value and great design for workout or even casual wear.,,,,,,,
1.5 sizes too big but wearable. If wear a medium maybe opt for a small.,,,,,,,
Fit well and tighter than the Nike Womens Miler Short sleeve top,,,,,,,
Love this, its light weight and not clingy. I will be ordering again...,,,,,,
Comfy, however, little thick (warm) for summers,,,,,
This is more see through than the old dri-fit shirts. Its also on the large side. Im usually between a small and medium and I got the small but it was still a bit large after a few rounds in the dryer on high. Pretty color though and seems like its made well.,,,,,,,
"i dont know what happened but I bought 2 dry-fit T shirts size L (I have one M and it is a little tight thats why I bought L), but what I received wasnt what I expected. I had to give them to my husband and they fit them ok.
I am in argentina so I cant sned them back.
It was a waste of money.",,,,,,,
Niceeee nicceeee shirt,,,,,,,
Love Nike gear,,,,,,,
good quality,,,,,,,
Good shirt!,,,,,,,
Not even the same shirt that was shown! The purple is actually a dark pinkish color not a deep purple like what is in the images and description. It doesnt have the nike logo on the front and it has mesh on the back and sides. Not at all what was shown in the pictures.,,,,,,,
The color. Was not what the web site showed.,,,,,,,
Great Shirt,,,,,,,
Arrived quickly and great price!,,,,,,,
Ordered the Royal blue . Its much much brighter than the picture. Also ordered an XS and is still too big. Cannot wear it for this race.,,,,,,,
Nice color,,,,,,,
Nice color - if you are looking for a fitted look this is not the shirt - I wear a medium and its a little big - but the small would have been to small,,,,,,,
Wonderful shirt! Looks great and feels better. My daughter typically wears a womens small to med.so we hot small and its still loose,,,,,,,
Love this shirt!! I use it for my gym workouts, very comfortable and goes with everything.,,,,,,
Nice fit and very light,,,,,,,
It was larger than I expected. I should have ordered a small one for next time. But overall its comfortable for workout so Im happy with it.,,,,,,,
I received this shirt the day after I ordered it! And then ordered it in another color because of how perfect it is,,,,,,,
I love this material. When I work out and wear this shirt I dont feel like it weighs me down when I sweat,,,,,,,
Nothing like last years Legend Tee which fit better and I liked the material better.,,,,,,,
Great condition,,,,,,,
Fits great, nice material!,,,,,,
Its bit large but I like that for my jiu jitsu class.. Good buy and fast delivery,,,,,,,
very bad quality......the logo not white,its gray logo......its exist in local market by 3 usd,,,,,,
You can find a better product fot that price, too expensive and not that great,,,,,,
Very nice,,,,,,,
Excellent fit! Quality fabric. Love the color. Holds up to frequent washing and drying. Couldnt be happier.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt!,,,,,,,
Perfect cut. Not too tight but has a feminine, not boxy, cut. Love it.,,,,,
Color is not as shown, fit is loose.,,,,,,
Wish it was just a bit bigger in width. But it is just what I wanted for looks. Very comfortable. I have washed it and it did not shrink.,,,,,,,
Perfect, it was a gift, She loved it,,,,,
Color is it even close to what is pictured. Its is not a bright gold/yellow.. its a dull tan/pale gold color,,,,,,,
This shirt is the only shirt I use for exercising. I have five of them and love them. The fit is perfect.,,,,,,,
perfect fit,,,,,,,
It wasnt as nice as the one with the same name (DriFit) purchased in a store; its a very thin material.,,,,,,,
Clearly not a real small!,,,,,,,
Great fit, true to size,,,,,,
arrived in time for Christmas. Fit perfectly.,,,,,,,
Arrived on time and exactly as described.,,,,,,,
Thinner than some of my other Nike tops but a good length. I would buy again!,,,,,,,
Fits my wife perfectly. Looks great and keeps you cool on hot days!,,,,,,,
Grandaughter loves it !,,,,,,,
Great length and light weight. True to color,,,,,,,
The fit was as expected. Im very happy with this shirt. Its soft, thick enough to not see through and long enough so I can go through airport security and raise my arms without showing my stomach. I love it,,,,,,
Great t-shirt but runs small. Very fit cut,,,,,,,
good, but I had a mistake when I choose the size, it is too long, it covered my hip,,,,
This is not yellow. It is beige. I like the shirt but dont order unless you want beige.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt feels great,,,,,,,
Love it,,,,,,,
Runs a tiny bit large but fast shipping and exactly what I was looking for,,,,,,,
Runs long, but happy to have senior rear covered.,,,,,,
Fitted as expected! Keeps me cool during a workout,,,,,,,
What i wanted,,,,,,,
Love it,,,,,,,
"i hate this shirt. it is NOT like my other Nike crew neck dry fit shirt.
they obviously discountinued the one i like because i cant find it anywhere.
this is not a fitted shirt. i wear a small( in a fitted shirt) this one fits baggy and loose and long.",,,,,,,
Great material and comfort,,,,,,,
ok,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,
Love it!!,,,,,,,
Very cool garment; will enjoy wearing it!,,,,,,,
I LOVE IT!,,,,,,,
Love it! Easy handling when traveling.,,,,,,,
Excellent product , highly recommended.,,,,,,
This is a nice basic workout t-shirt. It keeps you dry, fit well and is comfortable.,,,,,,
Great fit.,,,,,,,
I didnt like the quality!,,,,,,,
Love this,,,,,,,
Fits comfortably,,,,,,,
Very confortable,,,,,,,
Great top for soccer.,,,,,,,
Ok a bit long...,,,,,,,
Super large neck line,,,,,,,
I bought this shirt thinking the size would run large as thats what many of the reviews said. I did not feel that way about this shirt. I did not like the way it fit me. I am pretty broad and chesty and this shirt was definitely unflattering. It is made for very slim and petite women, not for me. I returned it immediately.,,,,,,
Bought this for my older sister as a christimas present. She loves it so much and commonly gets compliments on it! I plan on getting her a few more next christmas.,,,,,,,
Good as expected.,,,,,,,
Great feeling, rapids drying shirts. Planning a motorcycle trip and taking along a few of these. Rinse out at night and let hand dry.,,,,,,
Great fit, super comfortable, warm, but doesnt make you sweat. Its a perfect workout shirt or great for wearing under a jersey.,,,,
"I enjoy this shirt, as it works for what I intended it for. It was a little bigger than expected, bigger than many other ""Large"" shirts I have but not overly large. Its just a bit loose and a little thin, thats all. Works great though, as I use it as an undershirt in layering for the upper Midwest winters, as it can be quite cold up here. Comfortable, but it should be a bit cheaper, like $20 would be more acceptable. My main gripe is that Nike is really pushing it selling it for about $30 (for just a plain white t-shirt!) just because they can.",,,,,,,
This shirt is very nice, I bought the green one for my husband. The material is thinner but it falls and fits very nice, it does not cling. I highly recommend this shirt.,,,,,
These teet-shirts fit the way I wanted them to, for the size I thought. I have no problem ordering the way I had , thank you.,,,,,
Nice lightweight shirt. Great for working out, or wearing in the sun when you need extra coverage, but want to stay cool.,,,,,
some what too large but good quality sleeves a little too long also good quality so i gave it 3 stars no i would not buy again,,,,,,,
Great training shirt. Dont expect these to keep you warm as they are pretty thin, however they are very nice and soft and looks great. Its a somewhat fitted shirt, so make sure you dont have a tummy or it will show lol.,,,,,
My husband loves this Tee. He washes it in woolite and hang to dry. Last a long time!,,,,,,,
Comfortable, but like any other white workout shirt, will stain with sunscreen.,,,,,
My significant other was very happy with the material of this shirt and it fit perfect,,,,,,,
The sizes run smaller than most, had to return it. Sorry to say they didnt have same in larger sizes.,,,,,,
Excellent quality and price. Fit perfectly. My husband love it.,,,,,,,
Cheap quality with thin material. Not happy with what I got for the price.,,,,,,,
Warm yet cool, looks fresh and feels great. No issues, fits well.,,,,,
Needed a purple shirt. This was a great choice.,,,,,,,
Great Fit! Perfect Wash and Wear!!,,,,,,,
Son loves it. He looks good in it,,,,,,,
Great product, great seller!!!,,,,,,
Im slightly disappointed because the image I viewed appeared that the product faded from a washed out purple to a saturated purple below the shoulders. I referenced the same image while writing this review and have determined that flood lighting is creating a washed out effect on the promotional image. I used the item as a wind breaker over a sweat shirt for a team event that required a purple shirt. I will normally use it as a winter running shirt.,,,,,,,
too big not matter what size,,,,,,,
love the design and fit,,,,,,,
A little bit longer on sleeves than hope for but all in all great!,,,,,,,
nice shirt, comfy and well made,,,,,,
Looks great and fits well,,,,,,,
a gift and was loved,,,,,,,
Another satisfied customer,,,,,,,
Fits great. Extra coverage to keep the sun off during the long runs. Easy clean. Love it!,,,,,,,
Got it for our son-in-law for Christmas - he loved it and has worn it several times!,,,,,,,
Great color and size is a good fit. Happy with purchase.,,,,,,,
Fantastic product. Im absolutely in love with Nike Dri-Fit products,,,,,,,
I got this shirt as a gift for my boyfriend and he really likes it. It fits as expected and he likes that its light on him while he runs. Very timely shipping!,,,,,,,
I purchased one of these in hope of finding something that is light enough to wear and use at the gym, but still thick enough to where my nips wouldnt be popping out the whole time. Im pleased with the buy. The quality is great. Im 511 and weigh about 165-70. I went with a large and am happy i did so. Wear a tank top underneath though. If your gym is cold your nips mighy show.,,,,,,
Very good quality. Great value.,,,,,,,
Fits nice and feels good.,,,,,,,
Comfy,,,,,,,
Excellent product, price and shipping,,,,,,
Fits perfect,,,,,,,
Nice shirt. I have one in gray and now this one in white. I like the fit, i.e., not baggy, and the thinness of the fabric. Other brands are thicker, and I find that makes me too hot while exercising. Also great to wear in the sun.,,,
Bought this for my son and he loves it! Fits as expected!,,,,,,,
This is made in Mexico. The Vietnam fabric is much better.,,,,,,,
I liked this Nike long sleeve a lot.,,,,,,,
Too large,,,,,,,
Great,,,,,,,
I got the large. It looks great, however really is....welll.... quite large. I am 6 feet tall, around 200 pounds with a relatively athletic physique and this is still quite a bit too big on me. Feels more like an extra large. Insanely comfortable though and it still looks great. I would just size down if at all possible.,,,,,
I bought this shirt for longer runs (10+ miles) here in Central Florida on days when it is typically over 90 degrees and over 90% humidity. It definitely makes a difference with the white color as it is highly reflective and keeps you cooler in that regard. Secondly, you are now evaporating sweat from both your skin and the shirt, creating a better core temp cooling mechanism. I recommend.,,,,,
Super super comfortable an awesome looking but the only problem is when you order a large it comes in a slightly smaller size so its not Amazons fault, but rather Nikes for making a shirt and not giving it the proper size but overall still a great purchase and a goal to work towards,,,,,,
The long sleeves feels good but the size are a little bigger then what I ordered. I wear a medium but when I put this on, it feels and look a little bigger then medium but a little smaller then a large.,,,,,,
"Great breathable and ultra-light running shirt! The fit for the M is spot on for someone bw around 510 - 62"", with decent chest room (ie not too snug)",,,,,,,
"Comfortable dry-fit long sleeve t-shirt.
Fits well on medium frame-size.
Made in Jordan.",,,,,,,
great for the gym!,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,
Ive bought several of these. Their great to work out in or to lounge around in.,,,,,,,
bought this for a co-worker for secret santa. bought him a medium but it fits like a large. He still uses it though :) shipped and delivered on time,,,,,,,
"This was ordered for my very thin grandson. He usually wears a mens small, but this was still a bit loose in the small, but he still likes it.
",,,,,,,
100f outside and this long sleeve is keeping me cool, love thus shirt buying more,,,,,,
Fits well like to wear to the gym with my Nike Mens Free Trainer 3.0 V3 Training Shoe [Color: Game Royal/White] its a perfect match. When you running keeps the sweat under control. This way when you leave the gym you arent exposed to the cold air. I have few brands of shirts, but actually find these the most comfortable.,,,,,,
Just as you would expect. But smaller than most. Would get the next size up,,,,,,,
"Nice fit
not see through own two",,,,,,,
shirt feels very good on skin. keeps you cool and fits as expected,,,,,,,
I would recommend. Love the fit and color. No surprises here.,,,,,,,
Very good shirt made with nice expensive looking material. The shirt fits very well. I purchased the purple because most of the other colors were sold out in large. I was skeptical of the color because its purple. However, the shirt looks really good on.,,,,,,
Bought it for a Christmas gift & they loved it,,,,,,,
great shirt - fits accordingly and looks great - highly recommend,,,,,,,
"I ordered size M, its a little tight around chest, sending it back.

The material is dri-fit, very thin, but durable, not too bad for $32 I paid.",,,,,,,
A little oversized, decent quality.,,,,,,
I love this ! I would buy more!,,,,,,,
Nice color and fit,,,,,,,
Came in as red and not maroon my boyfriend ended up keeping it but now he has two of the same color,,,,,,,
Dont typically buy clothing from Amazon, but my husband has a NIKE Black long sleeve crew and wanted a white one. The size is accurate.,,,,,,
The outside tag said Large but when tried on realized it was very tight. The inside tag showed it was a small.,,,,,,,
exelent,,,,,,,
some of these run so small like they are meant for undershirts or workout only but this is a good shirt for relaxing or casual wear no form fitting,,,,,,,
I bought this lightweight dry fit for my husband to wear to the gym. He loves it. It provides extra warmth under his t shirt because our gym is always freezing cold. I bought a medium, he weighs about 165 and is 5 10 and it fits true to size.,,,,,,
great!!!,,,,,,,
Got for my father-in-law for Christmas, who usually wears a Tall, and it fit very well. He loved it so much he wore it two days in a row! LOL!,,,,,
Nice Shirt.,,,,,,,
Great fit and quality, exactly what I needed,,,,,,
Fits well throughout chest and back etc. Was expecting more of a tight fit through the arms however and wrists, however. All in all a great shirt though.,,,,,,
Great purchase. Im 62 200 pounds and ordered a large. The shirt fits great and came MUCH faster than the ETA,,,,,,,
The upper part of the sleeves are oddly baggy, while the lower forearm fits as expected. My husband isnt really a fan of it, but I think I will try to alter it so the upper arms fit more like they should.,,,,,
Great shirt for the price....Very comfortable!,,,,,,,
I was very disappointed. It was thinner and more see-through than the picture depicted. I will just use it as an undershirt on a cold day.,,,,,,,
Arrived on time and looks okay - not really impressed with the material and it had a weird smell to it when it first arrived.,,,,,,,
you can buy it at the same price outside.,,,,,,,
I bought two of these and love them. Loose fitting and lightweight. Perfect for working, hiking/camping, or just lounging around the house.,,,,,
Fits beautifully,,,,,,,
Love this shirt. Excellent for working out in or just casual wear.,,,,,,,
I have three of these all different colors. Ordered them from the same place. Fast shipping! Will buy a few more in different colors soon.,,,,,,,
"A gift for my hubby, He is 511"" 173lbs, I got him size L. It fits well.",,,,,,,
Bought it for my husband, looks And fits great,,,,,,
It was perfect just what my grandson wanted. The fit was just right, the purple was a beautiful color. Very pleased.,,,,,,
Perfect fit, great for running.,,,,,,
For some reason this fabric snags very easily on velcro. (the hook side). I have a dozen of these NikeFit that I bought years ago that dont do that.,,,,,,,
Bit larger than description.,,,,,,,
These are sized a little bigger than you would think or are used too. But the quality is still the NIKE quality. I would easy buy again.,,,,,,,
An excellent & interesting transaction,,,,,,,
Dri-Fit T-shirts are a great idea. I wear it when I play tennis in the sun to keep the sun off of my arms. It is great!,,,,,,,
I really love this as a long sleeve under shirt, under my golf polo shirts. Or can be worn as an outer shirt, its not very heavy, very light breathable material,,,,
"Great fit , exactly as described, fast delivery
I would order from this seller again",,,,,,,
My husband loves these shirts for running in the winter. Bought as a Christmas present.,,,,,,,
"I bought this t-shirt for my daughters boy friend he loved it.
Beautiful blue",,,,,,,
My husband really likes these shirts and this one is one of his favorites. Its thin enough to wear underneath a sweatshirt/fleece or to layer over a tshirt. Dri-fit material.,,,,,,,
It is great and my nephew loved it, the material was comfortable and the fit was good,,,,,,
Bought as a gift for my brother - he loves it! Stated is was comfortable and washed great. He is tall and has broad shoulders - fit great all the way around.,,,,,,,
Perfect shirt if you are running outdoors in the winter or late fall. It fits loose and is very comfortable! I would definitely reccommend this product.,,,,,,,
Great shirt, cool, nice material. Fits a littler big but is great for exercising when it is not that hot out.,,,,,
I rock one of these in a different color at least 5 days a week. Theyre legit af,,,,,,,
Arms are a bit tight where they attach to the body. Otherwise fits as expected.,,,,,,,
All perfect, thanks!!!!,,,,,,
Was not what i expected, please be careful of what the item description says and what your expectations are.,,,,,,
??,,,,,,,
Slow ship but worth the wait.,,,,,,,
I am somewhat dissapointed with how dark the color of the shirt is .,,,,,,,
Great long sleeve running shirt. Ive owned these before so no big surprise.,,,,,,,
Nike is still the best dry fit weave available, Ive bought adidas and others but they can be scratchy.,,,,,,
This shirt will get you hella chicks,,,,,,,
Too thin !Long sleeves!,,,,,,,
Fits perfectly and material is light for late spring/early fall weather in the mid-west.,,,,,,,
You get what you pay for. Very thin, badly fitting shirt,,,,,,
Fits good, but this is way light weight. In fact you can see right thought this shirt? For the price I thought it would be higher quality Nike.,,,,,,
Nice quality and good finishing as well. If you have an athletic body type this would look perfect. I use these for gym and dont feel sweaty.,,,,,,,
Bought a medium; small would probably be the right fit,,,,,,,
Fits just as expected. Im very happy with my purchase,,,,,,,
Great color,though i wish the swoosh was embroidered..,,,,,,
Ive bought several of these & they are a good look & so comfortable!,,,,,,,
"It isnt made of the same material as the ""Nike Dri-fit"". The item is also too small.
Not happy with this purchase.",,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
I was skeptical, but believe all the other reviewers now- this runs really a size or size and a half big. I usually wear a L, but this was the biggest, longest M Ive ever seen!,,,,
Fits perfectly. Feels great in the heat considering I walk all day as a letter carrier.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt, fits very good. Like the fabric. Will be good sun protection without being too hot.,,,,,,
I like the color, the fit, the weight (perfect for coolish summer days).,,,,,
Loved it!,,,,,,,
Awesome shirt and fits as expected..,,,,,,,
Loose sleeves exactly what I wanted for bug protection.,,,,,,,
Fits slightly bigger than expected, but great product. Exactly what I was looking for!,,,,,,
Light and dry feel.,,,,,,,
My husband likes this shirt a lot,,,,,,,
The material is strange. Tends to hold body odor and doesnt breathe well. Not liking it so far,,,,,,,
Grandson was very proud of it.,,,,,,,
great fit, just what i wanted,,,,,,
very nice fit true to sizing,,,,,,,
Shirt fits loosely, but is true to size.,,,,,,
Shirt was the perfect gift.,,,,,,,
Good shirt but doesnt fit as expected.,,,,,,,
like it wont buy again was charge shipping should have been free my order said 1 of 2 on this order ps who can i contact on this ?,,,,,,,
Bought this as a gift for a friend at the gym. He loved it and it fits him great.,,,,,,,
very comfortable shirt.,,,,,,,
Great shirt. Love it!,,,,,,,
Its a nice shirt, but it was for my 13 year old son and it almost fits my husband who wears a large.,,,,,,
it is not cotton , it looks like the football Tshirt in its material ,,,,,,
Good quality material,,,,,,,

Fits great, looks great and the material is high quality.,,,,,,
Returned. Too big. My fault for trusting the 4 yr. old size of Nike Dri-Fit apparel.,,,,,,,
"Never bought anything from Nike I didnt like.. Versatile true to size cool color shirt
Well made",,,,,,,
A little big in the arms. My boyfriend loves it and its great quality,,,,,,,
A little tight but perfect for an under layer.,,,,,,,
Husband is very happy with this tee & I was happy with the price!,,,,,,,
Awsome,,,,,,,
great,,,,,,,
Got a little big, but not extremely oversized, I like a lose fiting clothing.,,,,,
Perfect fit but I recommend medium or small size large looks like its a X-large long sleeve shirt,,,,,,,

Returned for one size smaller, arms way too long,,,,,,
Great shirt.,,,,,,,
Great quality and fit,,,,,,,

I purchased for travel. Stores well in the suit case and is comfortable for travel or by the pool. You cant go wrong.,,,,,,,
LOOKS GREAT!,,,,,,,
I would recommend getting a size smaller than ure size,,,,,,,
Very good Dri-Fit long sleeve shirt for running in cool weather.,,,,,,,
Absolutely Perfect!!,,,,,,,
Good quality...good fit.....nice material for a trip as it is easy to clean,,,,,,,
great shirt, very comfortable and form fitting,,,,,,
These shirts are great for working out. Keeps you dry and very comfortable. I have used them for hiking in cold weather as well as an undershirt to wick sweat away.,,,,,,,
Item as described,,,,,,,
Awesome like all things Nike. The only thing is the neck line runs a little loose for my liking. A thicker seam on the neckline would make this shirt perfect.,,,,,,,
Shirt fit as expected and was the exact shade of red I wanted.,,,,,,,
Fits well, easy to wrestle in and work out in,,,,,,
fits great,,,,,,,
Great,,,,,,,
Good shirt!,,,,,,,

Just right,,,,,,,
The shirt fits perfect and the price is alot cheaper than in a store!!,,,,,,,
awesome,,,,,,,
thx,,,,,,,
Great fit; light weight .Perfect to work out in which was just what he wanted.,,,,,,,
This shirt is great for warming up, light workouts, or running outside/on the treadmill. It fits really well, and is thin so it is very breathable.,,,,
Extraordinarily thin material. Maybe thats the way it is supposed to be.,,,,,,,
Very good,,,,,,,
thank you,,,,,,,
I love this,,,,,,,
GOOD!GOOD!GOOD!,,,,,,,

Good fits,,,,,,,
Love it!,,,,,,,
Excelent,,,,,,,
#swag,,,,,,,
good for price,,,,,,,
It fit well.,,,,,,,
Fast shipping. Exactly what i wanted,,,,,,,
Shirt fits very well, is very soft and comfortable. I ordered a few more in other colors. Good for exercising.,,,,,,
as expected,,,,,,,
fits great,,,,,,,
Ordered a size small...it was huge...and I am 5.10 and 150 LBs...,,,,,,,
Love these Nike Dri-Fit crew tops. Long sleeve or short sleeve they make for great casual shirts or workout shirts. Theyre breathable, durable, and fashionable. The heather grey color is my favorite. I bought this one to replace the one I let my friend borrow(which he has yet to return). Great product!,,,,,
My son wanted to purchase this. While I felt it was a bit overpriced, he was very happy with it. The material is very breathable.,,,,,,
Bought it for my husband. He loves these dry-fit tees and wanted this color. He was somewhat disappointed because it fit him larger than the other long sleeve dry-fit Nike tees that he has bought in the past. For future buyers, I recommend buying a size smaller.,,,,,,
Fit perfect - large as expected. Great material that dries quick.,,,,,,,
is bad,,,,,,,
I use this for golf when I go to practice and occasionally play. Feels great in Texas summers at 100+ degree heat. Usually a concern for me is how see threw the white is but I have not had that problem with this product! Am going to buy more and get a polo version as well,,,,,,,
This is a nice product, but the arms are very long compared with the body. If you need a shirt for a bigger body, but dont have particularly long arms, you may want to look at other similar products.,,,,
It doesnt feel like a Nike product. Looks like a cheap rip off.,,,,,,,
Solid shirt. I got this item for the gym but I also wear it when Im not in the gym. It is light so it is very breathable. I have a few short sleeve versions of this shirt but I think Ill be getting more of these in the future.,,,,,,,
"Really like the shirt but it definitely runs large. I am 62"" and the sleeves are long and the neck opening is larger than I would like. Really wish I had ordered a size smaller but stuck with an expensive t-shirt.",,,,,,,
Fit perfectly,,,,,,,
Very nice fit, color very true to picture and size was very accurate, my husband loved it,,,,,
The only problem I have is that I paid 30 dollars for a 28 dollar shirt. Thats what it said on the tag !! I should have looked further for a better deal !!,,,,,,,
I would advise anyone purchasing to order a size down. I ordered a medium and it looks like a large plus its a very loose material so that makes it even bigger fitting.,,,,,,,
My husband really likes this shirt however it swallows him. And the sleeves are long. Still giving 4 stars because for someone that it fits it would be perfect.,,,,,,,
This is a nice shirt for working out or casual wear. It is really thin material so can be worn in summer too. It fits nice, not super tight but like a t-shirt.,,,,,,
The shirt arrived quickly, and his extremely comfortable. I recommend this product for anyone that is interested in being comfortable while working out.,,,,,,
Everything arrived on time and in good condition. Great product for working out - exactly what I was hoping for / expected. Happy with my purchase,,,,,,,
He said its light weight very comfortable. As for me the wash, Can wear right out of dryer and its looks brand new. I bought all colors for him.,,,,,,
"The material is cheap. Not what I expected from reading the reviews. Ive bought actual Nike ""dri-fit"" from Nike and those were actually very durable and warm. This material is very thin. If you want it just for looks for the gym, I guess its ok but for its purpose -dont buy",,,,,,,
It doesnt seem authentic. It was huge. Small fit like a large. Material isnt similar to Nikes shirts.,,,,,,,
To large for me,,,,,,,
I ordered an XL and I received an XL Tall. Does not fit well at all. Product is not as described.,,,,,,,
Great it is exactly what I ordered.....great product and great price, would order more of these in the future for sure,,,,,,
The shirt was a little too big but I still use it. It works great and worth the price I paid.,,,,,,,
Excellent quality. My grandson loved it and it looked great on him. Very pleased.,,,,,,,
S Size was a bit large and wide for me in the sleeves, but still being a good product!,,,,,,
this product is very good, apart from their arrival shipping services consider them the best,,,,,,
Good fit and so far good quality to resistance to wear and tear,,,,,,,
No comment,,,,,,,
Nice Long Sleeve!,,,,,,,
great product snd customer service,,,,,,,
Its ok,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
Dont buy it. When i saw this first time in my eyes, i couldnt believe my eyes. I ordered T-shirt not dress. So I measured this stupid long bodied T-shirt, it was 29.5 inches. How can man have a body lengths of 29.5 inches? Besides the fact that i am Asian, this T-shirt is way too long.,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
I was expecting more of an under armor type of shirt. you know, tightly fit on the sleeves to show off biceps.? A bit loose on the arms and short in length of the entire shirt. fits kind of awkward for my taste. Good material though.,,,,,,
I hate the fit as that the large fits like a normal x-large. Something was wrong with the sizing.,,,,,,,
About 100% sure this shirt isnt a real Nike Dri-Fit. I own about 4 different Dri-fits and this one is counterfeit. The Nike swoosh looks and feels fake, the fabric doesnt feel like a Dri fit.,,,,,,
Excelente. Continuaré comprando a este vendedor. Tienda recomendada para hacer más compras internacionales. GRACIAS POR LA VENTA DEL PRODUCTO. SALUDOS,,,,,,,
Comfy sweater especially for work in the spring and fall,,,,,,,
I initially ordered a couple of these Nike long sleeve shirts in a couple of colors to check out the quality of the material and the workmanship. Some people had posted that the shirts were too sheer and too light for their use. All I can say is that these shirts are my new faves for working out and for wearing under quarter zip pullover shirts. I think I have ordered a total of six or seven of these shirts in various colors and I was actually contemplating ordering a few more when amazon sent an email message asking me to post a review on these shirts. The shirts are generously sized. The material is high quality and is very comfortable next to my skin, unlike some of my other long sleeve work out shirts. The workmanship is excellent. They come in a wide variety of colors. And, they are only +/- $25.00 each. Believe me, you will not be disappointed. These shirts are a great value. Enjoy... and just do it !!,,,,
This dri fit shirt is made of very very thin/fine fabric. It completely takes to the shape of your body. So unless youve got a banging body this might not be the shirt for you. The other dri fit materials are made of a hardier fabric that can kind of keep their shape. I didnt like this one because of the fit. But if youre a runner looking for a next to naked feeling dri fit shirt, this might be the shirt for you.,,,,,,
Nice shirt. I normally wear an x-lg t-shirt, so I got this in an x-lg as well, but I wish I had opted for a large. This kind of shirt wasnt meant to be this loose. My fault, though, so Im still giving it 5-stars. I guess Ill get another, but in large, and Ill just wear this one while doing yard-work or something. Id recommend you guys to consider getting a size smaller than usual.,
"Found my new favorite shirt(s) can wear it for a run or out to eat and very comfortable. Fits good 5""10 165 lbs size large (maybe a tad loose but not bad) very thin though. Nike makes a version 2.0 to this shirt that has some cotton rather than 100% poly that I like better but still love this shirt.",,,,,,,
"really low quality material for this shirt I was expecting something way better for the price and the Nike brand although Im doubting if its actually legit. The Nike logo isnt reflective neither the ""Dri-Fit"" something I found weird because if you look closely to the other shirts they say NikeFit. My chest is quite visble with this tshirt something that Im not a fan though and I used and sweated it and it doesnt dry as my other Nike or whatever other sport brand tshirt. Sadly Im not in the US otherwise Id ask for a refund.

This review isnt biased. Nobody is paying to talk about the crappy product I bought is just a customers opinion about a con over a ""Nike"" shirt. Sad

Here are some pictures of the product.",,,,,,,
"I bought this shirt b/c I wanted a long sleeve shirt to wear around the house that wasnt too warm. This works perfectly. Its light, cool, and extremely comfortable.

Regarding the size, Im 60 and weight 230. I tend to buy XXL size shirts, but on the suggestion of other reviews, I ordered an XL. The fit is perfect, which is to say that any purchasers should also consider ordering a size smaller than normal.",,,,,,,
"The fabric is thin but nice, its overall a good looking shirt, but I have to return it since it was far too large. I normally order medium (I am 5 10.5), but I ordered small (which is the smallest size available) based on the reviews. Both the shirt and the sleeves are about 1 longer than the maximum that I would tolerate. There is also a lot of extra fabric under the armpits and the shirt fits pretty loosely, so I would just order 1-2 sizes smaller if that was possible. The shirt label says ""S"", so I was sent the correct size.",,,,,,,
Very cheap shirt, not like the photo what so ever. Im not sure why so much good reviews but its the only reason I thought i was getting a nice shirt which is cheap looking shirt, the only reason for the two starts is the super fast shipping!! Not worth the money! Believe me....,,,,,
"Great shirt. Love the material and feel. I usually get a large, but purchased med because of reviews. Fits good but I like shirts to be a little more loose. Going to order a couple more but large this time. Im 510, 180.

11-16-15 I ordered 2 more. I am LE and wear under my uniform. Hold up well and very comfortable.",,,,,,,
"I bought these shirts in 2014 and my initial response to these shirts was they were fantastic. All the seams l lie flat inside and out. Fit was good felt great on so long as I only wore them short term. So for fit and quality of manufacture they would get 5 stars, but this is 2016 and I believe there are some other considerations and technologies that should be added to this type of shirt. I used these shirts as I worked maintenance for a condo and later as a pest control technician.

Having anti-odor/Anti-microbial technology made into the shirt didnt seem that important when I bought these items. However, it has to be if you need to wear a shirt made with this type of fabric longer than a few hours. When I wore these shirts under my short sleeve work shirt they became foul smelling on long hot days. I thought it might be me forgetting deodorant or something, I even carried a spare stick in my truck. After I switched to another brand with anti-odor/Anti-microbial properties I didnt have the odor issues I had with the Nike Dry Fit. So this consideration is rated by me a critical fail.

Additionally these are not advertised as having any sun protection capability, another component I need here in NW Florida. I now wear this type of shirt to play tennis to try to stay cool in the summer and get some protection from the sun to make my dermatologist happy. I want to avoid sunscreen so it doesnt mess up my grip on the racquet. After wearing these shirts for nearly a year my dermatologist treated and area in the middle of my back. Hence my renewed interest in UPF shirts. Again this area is rated by me as a critical fail.

Bottom Line: Just dont, I have to replace these Nike Dry Fit shirts to get the anti-odor/Anti-microbial and UPF 50 capabilities available in other shirts so I wasted my money on Nike. Im trying the Vapor Apparel Mens UPF Long Sleeve Solar Performance T-Shirt as a replacement.",,,,,,,
The Nike Mens Legend Poly Long Sleeve Dri-Fit T-shirt arrived within the scheduled time frame and was exactly as described on the site. It fits well, is very comfortable and I would recommend it to anyone that either works out or, wants to wear it as a long sleeved shirt under a short sleeved shirt.,,,,,
The sleeves are so long. Im 60. 165lbs. I wear an XL. The sleeves hang past my hands about 3-4 inches.,,,,,,,
"I bought this shirt from another site since it was a lot cheaper.

The shirt definitely runs large. Im 510"", 170 lbs, and usually wear mediums for Nike shirts, and they arent too loose on me. I bought a small of this shirt and it fits me very well, you could maybe even say its a little baggy, which is fine with me.

The shirt is thin, made to wear in the summer or for workouts, not the best to keep warm.

However, the shirt is very comfortable and its not too thin that you can see through it.",,,,,,,
This is a nice quality shirt, especially if you order the right size. I ordered it for my husband who is small in stature. He is 5ft. 7 and 150 pounds. I ordered a medium and it fits him very well. He loved the shirt so much that I ordered another one in Maroon. Unfortunately, they sent me the red which is why I only gave four stars as opposed to five. The only reason why I didnt send it back is because my husband decided to go ahead and keep the red even though that is not the color I wanted.,,,,,
Very nice fit and feel.Well made. Its a kind of a semi-mesh fabric that looks to be breathable. Would buy another one anytime soon. Im pleased with my purchase.,,,,,,,
"The picture of the product shows a Nike check.
Be aware the shirt may not have a Nike check.
As seen below, mine did not.",,,,,,,
"PRICED ABOVE MSRP. First thing first. These are Overpriced. This particular Nike Dri-Fit Training shirt has an MSRP of $22 (see picture of the tag from the green shirt for $22 and I paid $24 for it) and most of them listed here are going for $22-$30. That is ridiculous. You can go to Dicks Sporting Goods website and get them for $16.50. I ordered two of these shirts in red and green size XL for $23 and $24 respectively. The only reason I ordered these is because I thought they were the Dri-Fit Ts that normally retail for ~$35 and I thought I was getting a good deal. I have two of the $35 dri-fit t-shirts already, which fit really nice (not tight, I hate tight shirts, but not loose). These cheaper dri-fit t-shirts fit much larger than the $35 ones (see picture red $22 MSRP from amazon on left and navy $35 MSRP from Dicks on right, both XL). I am 63"", 230 lbs and the XL feels like I am wearing a dress.

I will be returning these shirts. I paid too much for what they actually are, and on top of that the fit is a little on the large size. There is no problem with the shirts quality wise, besides the larger fit. But if you do want one of these, do yourself a favor and dont order from here. Order it from Dicks for $16.50.",,,,,,,
"Fantastic product, the high quality stuff you expect from Nike.

Fits a tad large, but this is a performance shirt, so the idea behind it is to remove swear from the body and dry out. Dont expect this to hug at all, its meant to be a tad loose.

Awesome for warmer climates and situations where you gotta sweat but stay cool!",,,,,,,
Nice, comfortable shirt. I wear it playing tennis, jogging, boating, or just out running errands. It does seem to run a bit large, and long, but not so bad that I dont like it. I have several colors, and it is odd that they have such a wide range of prices. White was cheapest.
Im such a big fan of this running and workout shirt. It wicks moisture very well. I actually use it for hiking to keep my body cool, especially as a base layer during the spring or early fall.,,,,,,
The Nike Mens Legend shirt fit great for my son. He used it at summer camp as he was part of the purple cabin. He wore the shirt for all types of activities including game time, lunch/dinner, free time and various sporting events. The shirt did a great job wicking moisture away from his body and provided great protection from the elements. I would recommend this shirt as a great outdoor/indoor activity shirt.,,,,,
Nice fit and wears as advertised. Dri material retains slight smell after a few wears and washes. Does seem to go away after a deep soak and cleanse.,,,,,,,
Awesome and comfortable shirt! I wear when working out, playing tennis, and just around the house. Good price as well!,,,,,
This particular shirt came quite a bit larger than my other Medium Nike Dri-Fits. I noticed they were all made in different countries, so that might be the issue. Ill try and buy these shirts from local stores to make sure its the nice tight fit I was hoping for.,,,,,,
"Not yellow
It is a puke color and it was wadded up in the package
Don’t think it’s original nike",,,,,,,
Definitely great and authentic Nike quality, but a bit too large. Ordered a 2x, and its seriously huge.,,,,,
Quality is good but its extremely LARGE. Im 60 220pounds and the size large was dancing over my body,,,,,,,
Comfortable and fits well. I bought it late spring and have only worn it for a short run, but it breathed well. Would highly recommend it.,,,,,,
Purchased them for my daughter in law and she loves them. Very well made.,,,,,,,
fav longsleeve to work out it. i got the red/burgandy and always get compliments on the color,,,,,,,
Perfect Shirt, I love the high quality and it is very comfortable and light for the summer! I gave 4 stars because is a little large for me.,,,,,,
Great sports gear and my daughter loves them.,,,,,,,
It is an excellent product,,,,,,,
PERFECT ORANGE & FITS GREAT!,,,,,,,
Great looking casual shirt,,,,,,,
Very nice warm weather top for active sports.,,,,,,,
very thin fabric,,,,,,,
As noted, fit the person it was for great.,,,,,,
nice,,,,,,,
Just received the shirts and they fit as expected. Im very happy.,,,,,,,
XS is good fit but sleeves were too tight.,,,,,,,
I got this shirt today and I made the mistake to go by the size chart! Im 5ft 137lbs and according to the chart Im large but is way-way too big on me, Im returning this item.,,,,,,
I didnt realize this shirt was sheer. Super disappointed. I thought Id be able to wear it out for running errands & working out, but now I have to send it back.,,,,,,
Itchy... material not soft.,,,,,,,
Perfect for what I needed,,,,,,,
Cotton material, NOT dri-fit material. Not tight and I got an XS. Still a cute shirt but,,,,,,
Perfect,,,,,,,
I ordered a extra Large like all my others. This seems to run way small. Order up a size or two.,,,,,,,
I wear this every Monday Wednesday and Friday when I work on my upper body, it feels great! I love how it feels, I dont feel all nasty and wet and feel like my clothes is sticking to my body after Im done with my work out, not tight nice and loose, some people might not like it like that but I do, I recommend if you want it a little tight then get a size lower, I got the size I wear on my regular shirts and it was a little big but I like it like that.,
My husband loves these shirts!,,,,,,,
"The fit is good and I think for most people these would be perfect. I find I am always between sizes and this is no exception. My shoulders stick out a bit more than I would desire and the neck and arm holes are snug. I am 6 and weigh 175 43"" chest, 33"" waist so finding clothes is hard for me. Nonetheless these are high quality shirts that I will happily wear. They are a bit pricey for a sleeveless tee but they are Nike.",,,,,,,
"Fit was great, love the color, husband liked the ""muscle t"" look with the wider tank straps.",,,,,,,
super comfortable shirt,,,,,,,
Fits well and feels good,,,,,,,
Great shirt,,,,,,,
The shirt is fine but I got a medium and it is a little large. If you like your workout shirts a little looser than this is a good choice.,,,,,,,
I am very disappointed by the quality of this T shirt. It has a low quality material and does not compare to other Nike Dri-Fit clothing which we have bought in the past. After washing it once following the instructions it came out of the washer all fluffy with lots of lints on it (see the attached photo). I would not recommend buying it if you are looking for a good quality Dri-Fit T.,,,,,,,

This fits differently than my original Dri-Fit shirt, which I love. The shoulders are smaller, the material is different and a lighter weight (a little bit of see-through), and the torso is blousier. If you have broad or muscley shoulders, it will feel a bit tight. Overall weird fit for me.,,,
Seems to be cheaper material than Nikes other dry-fit shirts. A little long and loose around the waist, but I prefer that over being tight.,,,,,,
Will defiantly be replacing all my casual shirts with these in every color. Very nice material breaths well without being see through. Streatchy so very comfortable and perfect for outdoor activities and exercising drys quick exactly what it was supposed to do!,,,,,,,
I am a plus size after having a baby. I read the reviews of all those who said it ran large. I usually size up when buying online but due to those reviews I bought my usual size. This thing does not run big..,,,,,,,
The image is of a sports bra rather than of the black shirt I got for workouts.,,,,,,,
Fit really small but love the feel of the material wish it wouldve fit right,,,,,,,
"Great shirt for the gym. The M fit is somewhat loose, which I expected for the style.

Two stars because this shirt retails at $24.99 on the tag. Theyre selling at a premium.

My advice, wait until the price drops to at least $20 to get a better deal or run out to the nearest sporting goods store and buy one on sale at a retail store.",,,,,,,
I dont like to wear tight clothing when I run, but this was too big.,,,,,,
Excellent fit and the material dries fast. Great value and great design for workout or even casual wear.,,,,,,,
1.5 sizes too big but wearable. If wear a medium maybe opt for a small.,,,,,,,
Fit well and tighter than the Nike Womens Miler Short sleeve top,,,,,,,
Love this, its light weight and not clingy. I will be ordering again...,,,,,,
Comfy, however, little thick (warm) for summers,,,,,
This is more see through than the old dri-fit shirts. Its also on the large side. Im usually between a small and medium and I got the small but it was still a bit large after a few rounds in the dryer on high. Pretty color though and seems like its made well.,,,,,,,
"i dont know what happened but I bought 2 dry-fit T shirts size L (I have one M and it is a little tight thats why I bought L), but what I received wasnt what I expected. I had to give them to my husband and they fit them ok.
I am in argentina so I cant sned them back.
It was a waste of money.",,,,,,,
Niceeee nicceeee shirt,,,,,,,
Love Nike gear,,,,,,,
good quality,,,,,,,
Good shirt!,,,,,,,
Not even the same shirt that was shown! The purple is actually a dark pinkish color not a deep purple like what is in the images and description. It doesnt have the nike logo on the front and it has mesh on the back and sides. Not at all what was shown in the pictures.,,,,,,,
The color. Was not what the web site showed.,,,,,,,
Great Shirt,,,,,,,
Arrived quickly and great price!,,,,,,,
Ordered the Royal blue . Its much much brighter than the picture. Also ordered an XS and is still too big. Cannot wear it for this race.,,,,,,,
Nice color,,,,,,,
Nice color - if you are looking for a fitted look this is not the shirt - I wear a medium and its a little big - but the small would have been to small,,,,,,,
Wonderful shirt! Looks great and feels better. My daughter typically wears a womens small to med.so we hot small and its still loose,,,,,,,
Love this shirt!! I use it for my gym workouts, very comfortable and goes with everything.,,,,,,
Nice fit and very light,,,,,,,
It was larger than I expected. I should have ordered a small one for next time. But overall its comfortable for workout so Im happy with it.,,,,,,,
I received this shirt the day after I ordered it! And then ordered it in another color because of how perfect it is,,,,,,,
I love this material. When I work out and wear this shirt I dont feel like it weighs me down when I sweat,,,,,,,
Nothing like last years Legend Tee which fit better and I liked the material better.,,,,,,,
Great condition,,,,,,,
Fits great, nice material!,,,,,,
Its bit large but I like that for my jiu jitsu class.. Good buy and fast delivery,,,,,,,
very bad quality......the logo not white,its gray logo......its exist in local market by 3 usd,,,,,,
You can find a better product fot that price, too expensive and not that great,,,,,,
Very nice,,,,,,,
Excellent fit! Quality fabric. Love the color. Holds up to frequent washing and drying. Couldnt be happier.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt!,,,,,,,
Perfect cut. Not too tight but has a feminine, not boxy, cut. Love it.,,,,,
Color is not as shown, fit is loose.,,,,,,
Wish it was just a bit bigger in width. But it is just what I wanted for looks. Very comfortable. I have washed it and it did not shrink.,,,,,,,
Perfect, it was a gift, She loved it,,,,,
Color is it even close to what is pictured. Its is not a bright gold/yellow.. its a dull tan/pale gold color,,,,,,,
This shirt is the only shirt I use for exercising. I have five of them and love them. The fit is perfect.,,,,,,,
perfect fit,,,,,,,
It wasnt as nice as the one with the same name (DriFit) purchased in a store; its a very thin material.,,,,,,,
Clearly not a real small!,,,,,,,
Great fit, true to size,,,,,,
arrived in time for Christmas. Fit perfectly.,,,,,,,
Arrived on time and exactly as described.,,,,,,,
Thinner than some of my other Nike tops but a good length. I would buy again!,,,,,,,
Fits my wife perfectly. Looks great and keeps you cool on hot days!,,,,,,,
Grandaughter loves it !,,,,,,,
Great length and light weight. True to color,,,,,,,
The fit was as expected. Im very happy with this shirt. Its soft, thick enough to not see through and long enough so I can go through airport security and raise my arms without showing my stomach. I love it,,,,,,
Great t-shirt but runs small. Very fit cut,,,,,,,
good, but I had a mistake when I choose the size, it is too long, it covered my hip,,,,
This is not yellow. It is beige. I like the shirt but dont order unless you want beige.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt feels great,,,,,,,
Love it,,,,,,,
Runs a tiny bit large but fast shipping and exactly what I was looking for,,,,,,,
Runs long, but happy to have senior rear covered.,,,,,,
Fitted as expected! Keeps me cool during a workout,,,,,,,
What i wanted,,,,,,,
Love it,,,,,,,
"i hate this shirt. it is NOT like my other Nike crew neck dry fit shirt.
they obviously discountinued the one i like because i cant find it anywhere.
this is not a fitted shirt. i wear a small( in a fitted shirt) this one fits baggy and loose and long.",,,,,,,
Great material and comfort,,,,,,,
ok,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,
Love it!!,,,,,,,
Very cool garment; will enjoy wearing it!,,,,,,,
I LOVE IT!,,,,,,,
Love it! Easy handling when traveling.,,,,,,,
Excellent product , highly recommended.,,,,,,
This is a nice basic workout t-shirt. It keeps you dry, fit well and is comfortable.,,,,,,
Great fit.,,,,,,,
I didnt like the quality!,,,,,,,
Love this,,,,,,,
Fits comfortably,,,,,,,
Very confortable,,,,,,,
Great top for soccer.,,,,,,,
Ok a bit long...,,,,,,,
Super large neck line,,,,,,,
I bought this shirt thinking the size would run large as thats what many of the reviews said. I did not feel that way about this shirt. I did not like the way it fit me. I am pretty broad and chesty and this shirt was definitely unflattering. It is made for very slim and petite women, not for me. I returned it immediately.,,,,,,
Bought this for my older sister as a christimas present. She loves it so much and commonly gets compliments on it! I plan on getting her a few more next christmas.,,,,,,,
Good as expected.,,,,,,,
Great feeling, rapids drying shirts. Planning a motorcycle trip and taking along a few of these. Rinse out at night and let hand dry.,,,,,,
Great fit, super comfortable, warm, but doesnt make you sweat. Its a perfect workout shirt or great for wearing under a jersey.,,,,
"I enjoy this shirt, as it works for what I intended it for. It was a little bigger than expected, bigger than many other ""Large"" shirts I have but not overly large. Its just a bit loose and a little thin, thats all. Works great though, as I use it as an undershirt in layering for the upper Midwest winters, as it can be quite cold up here. Comfortable, but it should be a bit cheaper, like $20 would be more acceptable. My main gripe is that Nike is really pushing it selling it for about $30 (for just a plain white t-shirt!) just because they can.",,,,,,,
This shirt is very nice, I bought the green one for my husband. The material is thinner but it falls and fits very nice, it does not cling. I highly recommend this shirt.,,,,,
These teet-shirts fit the way I wanted them to, for the size I thought. I have no problem ordering the way I had , thank you.,,,,,
Nice lightweight shirt. Great for working out, or wearing in the sun when you need extra coverage, but want to stay cool.,,,,,
some what too large but good quality sleeves a little too long also good quality so i gave it 3 stars no i would not buy again,,,,,,,
Great training shirt. Dont expect these to keep you warm as they are pretty thin, however they are very nice and soft and looks great. Its a somewhat fitted shirt, so make sure you dont have a tummy or it will show lol.,,,,,
My husband loves this Tee. He washes it in woolite and hang to dry. Last a long time!,,,,,,,
Comfortable, but like any other white workout shirt, will stain with sunscreen.,,,,,
My significant other was very happy with the material of this shirt and it fit perfect,,,,,,,
The sizes run smaller than most, had to return it. Sorry to say they didnt have same in larger sizes.,,,,,,
Excellent quality and price. Fit perfectly. My husband love it.,,,,,,,
Cheap quality with thin material. Not happy with what I got for the price.,,,,,,,
Warm yet cool, looks fresh and feels great. No issues, fits well.,,,,,
Needed a purple shirt. This was a great choice.,,,,,,,
Great Fit! Perfect Wash and Wear!!,,,,,,,
Son loves it. He looks good in it,,,,,,,
Great product, great seller!!!,,,,,,
Im slightly disappointed because the image I viewed appeared that the product faded from a washed out purple to a saturated purple below the shoulders. I referenced the same image while writing this review and have determined that flood lighting is creating a washed out effect on the promotional image. I used the item as a wind breaker over a sweat shirt for a team event that required a purple shirt. I will normally use it as a winter running shirt.,,,,,,,
too big not matter what size,,,,,,,
love the design and fit,,,,,,,
A little bit longer on sleeves than hope for but all in all great!,,,,,,,
nice shirt, comfy and well made,,,,,,
Looks great and fits well,,,,,,,
a gift and was loved,,,,,,,
Another satisfied customer,,,,,,,
Fits great. Extra coverage to keep the sun off during the long runs. Easy clean. Love it!,,,,,,,
Got it for our son-in-law for Christmas - he loved it and has worn it several times!,,,,,,,
Great color and size is a good fit. Happy with purchase.,,,,,,,
Fantastic product. Im absolutely in love with Nike Dri-Fit products,,,,,,,
I got this shirt as a gift for my boyfriend and he really likes it. It fits as expected and he likes that its light on him while he runs. Very timely shipping!,,,,,,,
I purchased one of these in hope of finding something that is light enough to wear and use at the gym, but still thick enough to where my nips wouldnt be popping out the whole time. Im pleased with the buy. The quality is great. Im 511 and weigh about 165-70. I went with a large and am happy i did so. Wear a tank top underneath though. If your gym is cold your nips mighy show.,,,,,,
Very good quality. Great value.,,,,,,,
Fits nice and feels good.,,,,,,,
Comfy,,,,,,,
Excellent product, price and shipping,,,,,,
Fits perfect,,,,,,,
Nice shirt. I have one in gray and now this one in white. I like the fit, i.e., not baggy, and the thinness of the fabric. Other brands are thicker, and I find that makes me too hot while exercising. Also great to wear in the sun.,,,
Bought this for my son and he loves it! Fits as expected!,,,,,,,
This is made in Mexico. The Vietnam fabric is much better.,,,,,,,
I liked this Nike long sleeve a lot.,,,,,,,
Too large,,,,,,,
Great,,,,,,,
I got the large. It looks great, however really is....welll.... quite large. I am 6 feet tall, around 200 pounds with a relatively athletic physique and this is still quite a bit too big on me. Feels more like an extra large. Insanely comfortable though and it still looks great. I would just size down if at all possible.,,,,,
I bought this shirt for longer runs (10+ miles) here in Central Florida on days when it is typically over 90 degrees and over 90% humidity. It definitely makes a difference with the white color as it is highly reflective and keeps you cooler in that regard. Secondly, you are now evaporating sweat from both your skin and the shirt, creating a better core temp cooling mechanism. I recommend.,,,,,
Super super comfortable an awesome looking but the only problem is when you order a large it comes in a slightly smaller size so its not Amazons fault, but rather Nikes for making a shirt and not giving it the proper size but overall still a great purchase and a goal to work towards,,,,,,
The long sleeves feels good but the size are a little bigger then what I ordered. I wear a medium but when I put this on, it feels and look a little bigger then medium but a little smaller then a large.,,,,,,
"Great breathable and ultra-light running shirt! The fit for the M is spot on for someone bw around 510 - 62"", with decent chest room (ie not too snug)",,,,,,,
"Comfortable dry-fit long sleeve t-shirt.
Fits well on medium frame-size.
Made in Jordan.",,,,,,,
great for the gym!,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,
Ive bought several of these. Their great to work out in or to lounge around in.,,,,,,,
bought this for a co-worker for secret santa. bought him a medium but it fits like a large. He still uses it though :) shipped and delivered on time,,,,,,,
"This was ordered for my very thin grandson. He usually wears a mens small, but this was still a bit loose in the small, but he still likes it.
",,,,,,,
100f outside and this long sleeve is keeping me cool, love thus shirt buying more,,,,,,
Fits well like to wear to the gym with my Nike Mens Free Trainer 3.0 V3 Training Shoe [Color: Game Royal/White] its a perfect match. When you running keeps the sweat under control. This way when you leave the gym you arent exposed to the cold air. I have few brands of shirts, but actually find these the most comfortable.,,,,,,
Just as you would expect. But smaller than most. Would get the next size up,,,,,,,
"Nice fit
not see through own two",,,,,,,
shirt feels very good on skin. keeps you cool and fits as expected,,,,,,,
I would recommend. Love the fit and color. No surprises here.,,,,,,,
Very good shirt made with nice expensive looking material. The shirt fits very well. I purchased the purple because most of the other colors were sold out in large. I was skeptical of the color because its purple. However, the shirt looks really good on.,,,,,,
Bought it for a Christmas gift & they loved it,,,,,,,
great shirt - fits accordingly and looks great - highly recommend,,,,,,,
"I ordered size M, its a little tight around chest, sending it back.

The material is dri-fit, very thin, but durable, not too bad for $32 I paid.",,,,,,,
A little oversized, decent quality.,,,,,,
I love this ! I would buy more!,,,,,,,
Nice color and fit,,,,,,,
Came in as red and not maroon my boyfriend ended up keeping it but now he has two of the same color,,,,,,,
Dont typically buy clothing from Amazon, but my husband has a NIKE Black long sleeve crew and wanted a white one. The size is accurate.,,,,,,
The outside tag said Large but when tried on realized it was very tight. The inside tag showed it was a small.,,,,,,,
exelent,,,,,,,
some of these run so small like they are meant for undershirts or workout only but this is a good shirt for relaxing or casual wear no form fitting,,,,,,,
I bought this lightweight dry fit for my husband to wear to the gym. He loves it. It provides extra warmth under his t shirt because our gym is always freezing cold. I bought a medium, he weighs about 165 and is 5 10 and it fits true to size.,,,,,,
great!!!,,,,,,,
Got for my father-in-law for Christmas, who usually wears a Tall, and it fit very well. He loved it so much he wore it two days in a row! LOL!,,,,,
Nice Shirt.,,,,,,,
Great fit and quality, exactly what I needed,,,,,,
Fits well throughout chest and back etc. Was expecting more of a tight fit through the arms however and wrists, however. All in all a great shirt though.,,,,,,
Great purchase. Im 62 200 pounds and ordered a large. The shirt fits great and came MUCH faster than the ETA,,,,,,,
The upper part of the sleeves are oddly baggy, while the lower forearm fits as expected. My husband isnt really a fan of it, but I think I will try to alter it so the upper arms fit more like they should.,,,,,
Great shirt for the price....Very comfortable!,,,,,,,
I was very disappointed. It was thinner and more see-through than the picture depicted. I will just use it as an undershirt on a cold day.,,,,,,,
Arrived on time and looks okay - not really impressed with the material and it had a weird smell to it when it first arrived.,,,,,,,
you can buy it at the same price outside.,,,,,,,
I bought two of these and love them. Loose fitting and lightweight. Perfect for working, hiking/camping, or just lounging around the house.,,,,,
Fits beautifully,,,,,,,
Love this shirt. Excellent for working out in or just casual wear.,,,,,,,
I have three of these all different colors. Ordered them from the same place. Fast shipping! Will buy a few more in different colors soon.,,,,,,,
"A gift for my hubby, He is 511"" 173lbs, I got him size L. It fits well.",,,,,,,
Bought it for my husband, looks And fits great,,,,,,
It was perfect just what my grandson wanted. The fit was just right, the purple was a beautiful color. Very pleased.,,,,,,
Perfect fit, great for running.,,,,,,
For some reason this fabric snags very easily on velcro. (the hook side). I have a dozen of these NikeFit that I bought years ago that dont do that.,,,,,,,
Bit larger than description.,,,,,,,
These are sized a little bigger than you would think or are used too. But the quality is still the NIKE quality. I would easy buy again.,,,,,,,
An excellent & interesting transaction,,,,,,,
Dri-Fit T-shirts are a great idea. I wear it when I play tennis in the sun to keep the sun off of my arms. It is great!,,,,,,,
I really love this as a long sleeve under shirt, under my golf polo shirts. Or can be worn as an outer shirt, its not very heavy, very light breathable material,,,,
"Great fit , exactly as described, fast delivery
I would order from this seller again",,,,,,,
My husband loves these shirts for running in the winter. Bought as a Christmas present.,,,,,,,
"I bought this t-shirt for my daughters boy friend he loved it.
Beautiful blue",,,,,,,
My husband really likes these shirts and this one is one of his favorites. Its thin enough to wear underneath a sweatshirt/fleece or to layer over a tshirt. Dri-fit material.,,,,,,,
It is great and my nephew loved it, the material was comfortable and the fit was good,,,,,,
Bought as a gift for my brother - he loves it! Stated is was comfortable and washed great. He is tall and has broad shoulders - fit great all the way around.,,,,,,,
Perfect shirt if you are running outdoors in the winter or late fall. It fits loose and is very comfortable! I would definitely reccommend this product.,,,,,,,
Great shirt, cool, nice material. Fits a littler big but is great for exercising when it is not that hot out.,,,,,
I rock one of these in a different color at least 5 days a week. Theyre legit af,,,,,,,
Arms are a bit tight where they attach to the body. Otherwise fits as expected.,,,,,,,
All perfect, thanks!!!!,,,,,,
Was not what i expected, please be careful of what the item description says and what your expectations are.,,,,,,
??,,,,,,,
Slow ship but worth the wait.,,,,,,,
I am somewhat dissapointed with how dark the color of the shirt is .,,,,,,,
Great long sleeve running shirt. Ive owned these before so no big surprise.,,,,,,,
Nike is still the best dry fit weave available, Ive bought adidas and others but they can be scratchy.,,,,,,
This shirt will get you hella chicks,,,,,,,
Too thin !Long sleeves!,,,,,,,
Fits perfectly and material is light for late spring/early fall weather in the mid-west.,,,,,,,
You get what you pay for. Very thin, badly fitting shirt,,,,,,
Fits good, but this is way light weight. In fact you can see right thought this shirt? For the price I thought it would be higher quality Nike.,,,,,,
Nice quality and good finishing as well. If you have an athletic body type this would look perfect. I use these for gym and dont feel sweaty.,,,,,,,
Bought a medium; small would probably be the right fit,,,,,,,
Fits just as expected. Im very happy with my purchase,,,,,,,
Great color,though i wish the swoosh was embroidered..,,,,,,
Ive bought several of these & they are a good look & so comfortable!,,,,,,,
"It isnt made of the same material as the ""Nike Dri-fit"". The item is also too small.
Not happy with this purchase.",,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
I was skeptical, but believe all the other reviewers now- this runs really a size or size and a half big. I usually wear a L, but this was the biggest, longest M Ive ever seen!,,,,
Fits perfectly. Feels great in the heat considering I walk all day as a letter carrier.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt, fits very good. Like the fabric. Will be good sun protection without being too hot.,,,,,,
I like the color, the fit, the weight (perfect for coolish summer days).,,,,,
Loved it!,,,,,,,
Awesome shirt and fits as expected..,,,,,,,
Loose sleeves exactly what I wanted for bug protection.,,,,,,,
Fits slightly bigger than expected, but great product. Exactly what I was looking for!,,,,,,
Light and dry feel.,,,,,,,
My husband likes this shirt a lot,,,,,,,
The material is strange. Tends to hold body odor and doesnt breathe well. Not liking it so far,,,,,,,
Grandson was very proud of it.,,,,,,,
great fit, just what i wanted,,,,,,
very nice fit true to sizing,,,,,,,
Shirt fits loosely, but is true to size.,,,,,,
Shirt was the perfect gift.,,,,,,,
Good shirt but doesnt fit as expected.,,,,,,,

Bought this as a gift for a friend at the gym. He loved it and it fits him great.,,,,,,,

Very good Dri-Fit long sleeve shirt for running in cool weather.,,,,,,,
Absolutely Perfect!!,,,,,,,
Good quality...good fit.....nice material for a trip as it is easy to clean,,,,,,,
great shirt, very comfortable and form fitting,,,,,,
These shirts are great for working out. Keeps you dry and very comfortable. I have used them for hiking in cold weather as well as an undershirt to wick sweat away.,,,,,,,
Item as described,,,,,,,
Awesome like all things Nike. The only thing is the neck line runs a little loose for my liking. A thicker seam on the neckline would make this shirt perfect.,,,,,,,
Shirt fit as expected and was the exact shade of red I wanted.,,,,,,,
Fits well, easy to wrestle in and work out in,,,,,,
fits great,,,,,,,

Great fit; light weight .Perfect to work out in which was just what he wanted.,,,,,,,
This shirt is great for warming up, light workouts, or running outside/on the treadmill. It fits really well, and is thin so it is very breathable.,,,,
Extraordinarily thin material. Maybe thats the way it is supposed to be.,,,,,,,
Very good,,,,,,,

Excelent,,,,,,,
#swag,,,,,,,

It fit well.,,,,,,,
Fast shipping. Exactly what i wanted,,,,,,,
Shirt fits very well, is very soft and comfortable. I ordered a few more in other colors. Good for exercising.,,,,,,
as expected,,,,,,,
fits great,,,,,,,
Ordered a size small...it was huge...and I am 5.10 and 150 LBs...,,,,,,,
Love these Nike Dri-Fit crew tops. Long sleeve or short sleeve they make for great casual shirts or workout shirts. Theyre breathable, durable, and fashionable. The heather grey color is my favorite. I bought this one to replace the one I let my friend borrow(which he has yet to return). Great product!,,,,,
My son wanted to purchase this. While I felt it was a bit overpriced, he was very happy with it. The material is very breathable.,,,,,,
Bought it for my husband. He loves these dry-fit tees and wanted this color. He was somewhat disappointed because it fit him larger than the other long sleeve dry-fit Nike tees that he has bought in the past. For future buyers, I recommend buying a size smaller.,,,,,,
Fit perfect - large as expected. Great material that dries quick.,,,,,,,
is bad,,,,,,,
I use this for golf when I go to practice and occasionally play. Feels great in Texas summers at 100+ degree heat. Usually a concern for me is how see threw the white is but I have not had that problem with this product! Am going to buy more and get a polo version as well,,,,,,,
This is a nice product, but the arms are very long compared with the body. If you need a shirt for a bigger body, but dont have particularly long arms, you may want to look at other similar products.,,,,
It doesnt feel like a Nike product. Looks like a cheap rip off.,,,,,,,
Solid shirt. I got this item for the gym but I also wear it when Im not in the gym. It is light so it is very breathable. I have a few short sleeve versions of this shirt but I think Ill be getting more of these in the future.,,,,,,,
"Really like the shirt but it definitely runs large. I am 62"" and the sleeves are long and the neck opening is larger than I would like. Really wish I had ordered a size smaller but stuck with an expensive t-shirt.",,,,,,,
Fit perfectly,,,,,,,
Very nice fit, color very true to picture and size was very accurate, my husband loved it,,,,,
The only problem I have is that I paid 30 dollars for a 28 dollar shirt. Thats what it said on the tag !! I should have looked further for a better deal !!,,,,,,,
I would advise anyone purchasing to order a size down. I ordered a medium and it looks like a large plus its a very loose material so that makes it even bigger fitting.,,,,,,,
My husband really likes this shirt however it swallows him. And the sleeves are long. Still giving 4 stars because for someone that it fits it would be perfect.,,,,,,,
This is a nice shirt for working out or casual wear. It is really thin material so can be worn in summer too. It fits nice, not super tight but like a t-shirt.,,,,,,
The shirt arrived quickly, and his extremely comfortable. I recommend this product for anyone that is interested in being comfortable while working out.,,,,,,
Everything arrived on time and in good condition. Great product for working out - exactly what I was hoping for / expected. Happy with my purchase,,,,,,,
He said its light weight very comfortable. As for me the wash, Can wear right out of dryer and its looks brand new. I bought all colors for him.,,,,,,
"The material is cheap. Not what I expected from reading the reviews. Ive bought actual Nike ""dri-fit"" from Nike and those were actually very durable and warm. This material is very thin. If you want it just for looks for the gym, I guess its ok but for its purpose -dont buy",,,,,,,
It doesnt seem authentic. It was huge. Small fit like a large. Material isnt similar to Nikes shirts.,,,,,,,
To large for me,,,,,,,
I ordered an XL and I received an XL Tall. Does not fit well at all. Product is not as described.,,,,,,,
Great it is exactly what I ordered.....great product and great price, would order more of these in the future for sure,,,,,,
The shirt was a little too big but I still use it. It works great and worth the price I paid.,,,,,,,
Excellent quality. My grandson loved it and it looked great on him. Very pleased.,,,,,,,
S Size was a bit large and wide for me in the sleeves, but still being a good product!,,,,,,
this product is very good, apart from their arrival shipping services consider them the best,,,,,,
Good fit and so far good quality to resistance to wear and tear,,,,,,,
No comment,,,,,,,
Nice Long Sleeve!,,,,,,,
great product snd customer service,,,,,,,
Its ok,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
Dont buy it. When i saw this first time in my eyes, i couldnt believe my eyes. I ordered T-shirt not dress. So I measured this stupid long bodied T-shirt, it was 29.5 inches. How can man have a body lengths of 29.5 inches? Besides the fact that i am Asian, this T-shirt is way too long.,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
I was expecting more of an under armor type of shirt. you know, tightly fit on the sleeves to show off biceps.? A bit loose on the arms and short in length of the entire shirt. fits kind of awkward for my taste. Good material though.,,,,,,
I hate the fit as that the large fits like a normal x-large. Something was wrong with the sizing.,,,,,,,
About 100% sure this shirt isnt a real Nike Dri-Fit. I own about 4 different Dri-fits and this one is counterfeit. The Nike swoosh looks and feels fake, the fabric doesnt feel like a Dri fit.,,,,,,
Excelente. Continuaré comprando a este vendedor. Tienda recomendada para hacer más compras internacionales. GRACIAS POR LA VENTA DEL PRODUCTO. SALUDOS,,,,,,,
Comfy sweater especially for work in the spring and fall,,,,,,,
I initially ordered a couple of these Nike long sleeve shirts in a couple of colors to check out the quality of the material and the workmanship. Some people had posted that the shirts were too sheer and too light for their use. All I can say is that these shirts are my new faves for working out and for wearing under quarter zip pullover shirts. I think I have ordered a total of six or seven of these shirts in various colors and I was actually contemplating ordering a few more when amazon sent an email message asking me to post a review on these shirts. The shirts are generously sized. The material is high quality and is very comfortable next to my skin, unlike some of my other long sleeve work out shirts. The workmanship is excellent. They come in a wide variety of colors. And, they are only +/- $25.00 each. Believe me, you will not be disappointed. These shirts are a great value. Enjoy... and just do it !!,,,,
This dri fit shirt is made of very very thin/fine fabric. It completely takes to the shape of your body. So unless youve got a banging body this might not be the shirt for you. The other dri fit materials are made of a hardier fabric that can kind of keep their shape. I didnt like this one because of the fit. But if youre a runner looking for a next to naked feeling dri fit shirt, this might be the shirt for you.,,,,,,
Nice shirt. I normally wear an x-lg t-shirt, so I got this in an x-lg as well, but I wish I had opted for a large. This kind of shirt wasnt meant to be this loose. My fault, though, so Im still giving it 5-stars. I guess Ill get another, but in large, and Ill just wear this one while doing yard-work or something. Id recommend you guys to consider getting a size smaller than usual.,
"Found my new favorite shirt(s) can wear it for a run or out to eat and very comfortable. Fits good 5""10 165 lbs size large (maybe a tad loose but not bad) very thin though. Nike makes a version 2.0 to this shirt that has some cotton rather than 100% poly that I like better but still love this shirt.",,,,,,,
"really low quality material for this shirt I was expecting something way better for the price and the Nike brand although Im doubting if its actually legit. The Nike logo isnt reflective neither the ""Dri-Fit"" something I found weird because if you look closely to the other shirts they say NikeFit. My chest is quite visble with this tshirt something that Im not a fan though and I used and sweated it and it doesnt dry as my other Nike or whatever other sport brand tshirt. Sadly Im not in the US otherwise Id ask for a refund.

This review isnt biased. Nobody is paying to talk about the crappy product I bought is just a customers opinion about a con over a ""Nike"" shirt. Sad

Here are some pictures of the product.",,,,,,,
"I bought this shirt b/c I wanted a long sleeve shirt to wear around the house that wasnt too warm. This works perfectly. Its light, cool, and extremely comfortable.

Regarding the size, Im 60 and weight 230. I tend to buy XXL size shirts, but on the suggestion of other reviews, I ordered an XL. The fit is perfect, which is to say that any purchasers should also consider ordering a size smaller than normal.",,,,,,,
"The fabric is thin but nice, its overall a good looking shirt, but I have to return it since it was far too large. I normally order medium (I am 5 10.5), but I ordered small (which is the smallest size available) based on the reviews. Both the shirt and the sleeves are about 1 longer than the maximum that I would tolerate. There is also a lot of extra fabric under the armpits and the shirt fits pretty loosely, so I would just order 1-2 sizes smaller if that was possible. The shirt label says ""S"", so I was sent the correct size.",,,,,,,
Very cheap shirt, not like the photo what so ever. Im not sure why so much good reviews but its the only reason I thought i was getting a nice shirt which is cheap looking shirt, the only reason for the two starts is the super fast shipping!! Not worth the money! Believe me....,,,,,
"Great shirt. Love the material and feel. I usually get a large, but purchased med because of reviews. Fits good but I like shirts to be a little more loose. Going to order a couple more but large this time. Im 510, 180.

11-16-15 I ordered 2 more. I am LE and wear under my uniform. Hold up well and very comfortable.",,,,,,,
"I bought these shirts in 2014 and my initial response to these shirts was they were fantastic. All the seams l lie flat inside and out. Fit was good felt great on so long as I only wore them short term. So for fit and quality of manufacture they would get 5 stars, but this is 2016 and I believe there are some other considerations and technologies that should be added to this type of shirt. I used these shirts as I worked maintenance for a condo and later as a pest control technician.

Having anti-odor/Anti-microbial technology made into the shirt didnt seem that important when I bought these items. However, it has to be if you need to wear a shirt made with this type of fabric longer than a few hours. When I wore these shirts under my short sleeve work shirt they became foul smelling on long hot days. I thought it might be me forgetting deodorant or something, I even carried a spare stick in my truck. After I switched to another brand with anti-odor/Anti-microbial properties I didnt have the odor issues I had with the Nike Dry Fit. So this consideration is rated by me a critical fail.

Additionally these are not advertised as having any sun protection capability, another component I need here in NW Florida. I now wear this type of shirt to play tennis to try to stay cool in the summer and get some protection from the sun to make my dermatologist happy. I want to avoid sunscreen so it doesnt mess up my grip on the racquet. After wearing these shirts for nearly a year my dermatologist treated and area in the middle of my back. Hence my renewed interest in UPF shirts. Again this area is rated by me as a critical fail.

Bottom Line: Just dont, I have to replace these Nike Dry Fit shirts to get the anti-odor/Anti-microbial and UPF 50 capabilities available in other shirts so I wasted my money on Nike. Im trying the Vapor Apparel Mens UPF Long Sleeve Solar Performance T-Shirt as a replacement.",,,,,,,
The Nike Mens Legend Poly Long Sleeve Dri-Fit T-shirt arrived within the scheduled time frame and was exactly as described on the site. It fits well, is very comfortable and I would recommend it to anyone that either works out or, wants to wear it as a long sleeved shirt under a short sleeved shirt.,,,,,
The sleeves are so long. Im 60. 165lbs. I wear an XL. The sleeves hang past my hands about 3-4 inches.,,,,,,,
"I bought this shirt from another site since it was a lot cheaper.

The shirt definitely runs large. Im 510"", 170 lbs, and usually wear mediums for Nike shirts, and they arent too loose on me. I bought a small of this shirt and it fits me very well, you could maybe even say its a little baggy, which is fine with me.

The shirt is thin, made to wear in the summer or for workouts, not the best to keep warm.

However, the shirt is very comfortable and its not too thin that you can see through it.",,,,,,,
This is a nice quality shirt, especially if you order the right size. I ordered it for my husband who is small in stature. He is 5ft. 7 and 150 pounds. I ordered a medium and it fits him very well. He loved the shirt so much that I ordered another one in Maroon. Unfortunately, they sent me the red which is why I only gave four stars as opposed to five. The only reason why I didnt send it back is because my husband decided to go ahead and keep the red even though that is not the color I wanted.,,,,,
Very nice fit and feel.Well made. Its a kind of a semi-mesh fabric that looks to be breathable. Would buy another one anytime soon. Im pleased with my purchase.,,,,,,,
"The picture of the product shows a Nike check.
Be aware the shirt may not have a Nike check.
As seen below, mine did not.",,,,,,,
"PRICED ABOVE MSRP. First thing first. These are Overpriced. This particular Nike Dri-Fit Training shirt has an MSRP of $22 (see picture of the tag from the green shirt for $22 and I paid $24 for it) and most of them listed here are going for $22-$30. That is ridiculous. You can go to Dicks Sporting Goods website and get them for $16.50. I ordered two of these shirts in red and green size XL for $23 and $24 respectively. The only reason I ordered these is because I thought they were the Dri-Fit Ts that normally retail for ~$35 and I thought I was getting a good deal. I have two of the $35 dri-fit t-shirts already, which fit really nice (not tight, I hate tight shirts, but not loose). These cheaper dri-fit t-shirts fit much larger than the $35 ones (see picture red $22 MSRP from amazon on left and navy $35 MSRP from Dicks on right, both XL). I am 63"", 230 lbs and the XL feels like I am wearing a dress.

I will be returning these shirts. I paid too much for what they actually are, and on top of that the fit is a little on the large size. There is no problem with the shirts quality wise, besides the larger fit. But if you do want one of these, do yourself a favor and dont order from here. Order it from Dicks for $16.50.",,,,,,,
"Fantastic product, the high quality stuff you expect from Nike.

Fits a tad large, but this is a performance shirt, so the idea behind it is to remove swear from the body and dry out. Dont expect this to hug at all, its meant to be a tad loose.

Awesome for warmer climates and situations where you gotta sweat but stay cool!",,,,,,,
Nice, comfortable shirt. I wear it playing tennis, jogging, boating, or just out running errands. It does seem to run a bit large, and long, but not so bad that I dont like it. I have several colors, and it is odd that they have such a wide range of prices. White was cheapest.
Im such a big fan of this running and workout shirt. It wicks moisture very well. I actually use it for hiking to keep my body cool, especially as a base layer during the spring or early fall.,,,,,,
The Nike Mens Legend shirt fit great for my son. He used it at summer camp as he was part of the purple cabin. He wore the shirt for all types of activities including game time, lunch/dinner, free time and various sporting events. The shirt did a great job wicking moisture away from his body and provided great protection from the elements. I would recommend this shirt as a great outdoor/indoor activity shirt.,,,,,
Nice fit and wears as advertised. Dri material retains slight smell after a few wears and washes. Does seem to go away after a deep soak and cleanse.,,,,,,,
Awesome and comfortable shirt! I wear when working out, playing tennis, and just around the house. Good price as well!,,,,,
This particular shirt came quite a bit larger than my other Medium Nike Dri-Fits. I noticed they were all made in different countries, so that might be the issue. Ill try and buy these shirts from local stores to make sure its the nice tight fit I was hoping for.,,,,,,
"Not yellow
It is a puke color and it was wadded up in the package
Don’t think it’s original nike",,,,,,,
Definitely great and authentic Nike quality, but a bit too large. Ordered a 2x, and its seriously huge.,,,,,
Quality is good but its extremely LARGE. Im 60 220pounds and the size large was dancing over my body,,,,,,,
Comfortable and fits well. I bought it late spring and have only worn it for a short run, but it breathed well. Would highly recommend it.,,,,,,
Purchased them for my daughter in law and she loves them. Very well made.,,,,,,,
fav longsleeve to work out it. i got the red/burgandy and always get compliments on the color,,,,,,,
Perfect Shirt, I love the high quality and it is very comfortable and light for the summer! I gave 4 stars because is a little large for me.,,,,,,
Great sports gear and my daughter loves them.,,,,,,,
It is an excellent product,,,,,,,
PERFECT ORANGE & FITS GREAT!,,,,,,,
Great looking casual shirt,,,,,,,
Very nice warm weather top for active sports.,,,,,,,
very thin fabric,,,,,,,
As noted, fit the person it was for great.,,,,,,
nice,,,,,,,
Just received the shirts and they fit as expected. Im very happy.,,,,,,,
XS is good fit but sleeves were too tight.,,,,,,,
I got this shirt today and I made the mistake to go by the size chart! Im 5ft 137lbs and according to the chart Im large but is way-way too big on me, Im returning this item.,,,,,,
I didnt realize this shirt was sheer. Super disappointed. I thought Id be able to wear it out for running errands & working out, but now I have to send it back.,,,,,,
Itchy... material not soft.,,,,,,,
Perfect for what I needed,,,,,,,
Cotton material, NOT dri-fit material. Not tight and I got an XS. Still a cute shirt but,,,,,,
Perfect,,,,,,,
I ordered a extra Large like all my others. This seems to run way small. Order up a size or two.,,,,,,,
I wear this every Monday Wednesday and Friday when I work on my upper body, it feels great! I love how it feels, I dont feel all nasty and wet and feel like my clothes is sticking to my body after Im done with my work out, not tight nice and loose, some people might not like it like that but I do, I recommend if you want it a little tight then get a size lower, I got the size I wear on my regular shirts and it was a little big but I like it like that.,
My husband loves these shirts!,,,,,,,
"The fit is good and I think for most people these would be perfect. I find I am always between sizes and this is no exception. My shoulders stick out a bit more than I would desire and the neck and arm holes are snug. I am 6 and weigh 175 43"" chest, 33"" waist so finding clothes is hard for me. Nonetheless these are high quality shirts that I will happily wear. They are a bit pricey for a sleeveless tee but they are Nike.",,,,,,,
"Fit was great, love the color, husband liked the ""muscle t"" look with the wider tank straps.",,,,,,,
super comfortable shirt,,,,,,,
Fits well and feels good,,,,,,,
Great shirt,,,,,,,
The shirt is fine but I got a medium and it is a little large. If you like your workout shirts a little looser than this is a good choice.,,,,,,,
I am very disappointed by the quality of this T shirt. It has a low quality material and does not compare to other Nike Dri-Fit clothing which we have bought in the past. After washing it once following the instructions it came out of the washer all fluffy with lots of lints on it (see the attached photo). I would not recommend buying it if you are looking for a good quality Dri-Fit T.,,,,,,,

This fits differently than my original Dri-Fit shirt, which I love. The shoulders are smaller, the material is different and a lighter weight (a little bit of see-through), and the torso is blousier. If you have broad or muscley shoulders, it will feel a bit tight. Overall weird fit for me.,,,
Seems to be cheaper material than Nikes other dry-fit shirts. A little long and loose around the waist, but I prefer that over being tight.,,,,,,
Will defiantly be replacing all my casual shirts with these in every color. Very nice material breaths well without being see through. Streatchy so very comfortable and perfect for outdoor activities and exercising drys quick exactly what it was supposed to do!,,,,,,,
I am a plus size after having a baby. I read the reviews of all those who said it ran large. I usually size up when buying online but due to those reviews I bought my usual size. This thing does not run big..,,,,,,,
The image is of a sports bra rather than of the black shirt I got for workouts.,,,,,,,
Fit really small but love the feel of the material wish it wouldve fit right,,,,,,,
"Great shirt for the gym. The M fit is somewhat loose, which I expected for the style.

Two stars because this shirt retails at $24.99 on the tag. Theyre selling at a premium.

My advice, wait until the price drops to at least $20 to get a better deal or run out to the nearest sporting goods store and buy one on sale at a retail store.",,,,,,,
I dont like to wear tight clothing when I run, but this was too big.,,,,,,
Excellent fit and the material dries fast. Great value and great design for workout or even casual wear.,,,,,,,
1.5 sizes too big but wearable. If wear a medium maybe opt for a small.,,,,,,,
Fit well and tighter than the Nike Womens Miler Short sleeve top,,,,,,,
Love this, its light weight and not clingy. I will be ordering again...,,,,,,
Comfy, however, little thick (warm) for summers,,,,,
This is more see through than the old dri-fit shirts. Its also on the large side. Im usually between a small and medium and I got the small but it was still a bit large after a few rounds in the dryer on high. Pretty color though and seems like its made well.,,,,,,,
"i dont know what happened but I bought 2 dry-fit T shirts size L (I have one M and it is a little tight thats why I bought L), but what I received wasnt what I expected. I had to give them to my husband and they fit them ok.
I am in argentina so I cant sned them back.
It was a waste of money.",,,,,,,
Niceeee nicceeee shirt,,,,,,,
Love Nike gear,,,,,,,
good quality,,,,,,,
Good shirt!,,,,,,,
Not even the same shirt that was shown! The purple is actually a dark pinkish color not a deep purple like what is in the images and description. It doesnt have the nike logo on the front and it has mesh on the back and sides. Not at all what was shown in the pictures.,,,,,,,
The color. Was not what the web site showed.,,,,,,,
Great Shirt,,,,,,,
Arrived quickly and great price!,,,,,,,
Ordered the Royal blue . Its much much brighter than the picture. Also ordered an XS and is still too big. Cannot wear it for this race.,,,,,,,
Nice color,,,,,,,
Nice color - if you are looking for a fitted look this is not the shirt - I wear a medium and its a little big - but the small would have been to small,,,,,,,
Wonderful shirt! Looks great and feels better. My daughter typically wears a womens small to med.so we hot small and its still loose,,,,,,,
Love this shirt!! I use it for my gym workouts, very comfortable and goes with everything.,,,,,,
Nice fit and very light,,,,,,,
It was larger than I expected. I should have ordered a small one for next time. But overall its comfortable for workout so Im happy with it.,,,,,,,
I received this shirt the day after I ordered it! And then ordered it in another color because of how perfect it is,,,,,,,
I love this material. When I work out and wear this shirt I dont feel like it weighs me down when I sweat,,,,,,,
Nothing like last years Legend Tee which fit better and I liked the material better.,,,,,,,
Great condition,,,,,,,
Fits great, nice material!,,,,,,
Its bit large but I like that for my jiu jitsu class.. Good buy and fast delivery,,,,,,,
very bad quality......the logo not white,its gray logo......its exist in local market by 3 usd,,,,,,
You can find a better product fot that price, too expensive and not that great,,,,,,
Very nice,,,,,,,
Excellent fit! Quality fabric. Love the color. Holds up to frequent washing and drying. Couldnt be happier.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt!,,,,,,,
Perfect cut. Not too tight but has a feminine, not boxy, cut. Love it.,,,,,
Color is not as shown, fit is loose.,,,,,,
Wish it was just a bit bigger in width. But it is just what I wanted for looks. Very comfortable. I have washed it and it did not shrink.,,,,,,,
Perfect, it was a gift, She loved it,,,,,
Color is it even close to what is pictured. Its is not a bright gold/yellow.. its a dull tan/pale gold color,,,,,,,
This shirt is the only shirt I use for exercising. I have five of them and love them. The fit is perfect.,,,,,,,
perfect fit,,,,,,,
It wasnt as nice as the one with the same name (DriFit) purchased in a store; its a very thin material.,,,,,,,
Clearly not a real small!,,,,,,,
Great fit, true to size,,,,,,
arrived in time for Christmas. Fit perfectly.,,,,,,,
Arrived on time and exactly as described.,,,,,,,
Thinner than some of my other Nike tops but a good length. I would buy again!,,,,,,,
Fits my wife perfectly. Looks great and keeps you cool on hot days!,,,,,,,
Grandaughter loves it !,,,,,,,
Great length and light weight. True to color,,,,,,,
The fit was as expected. Im very happy with this shirt. Its soft, thick enough to not see through and long enough so I can go through airport security and raise my arms without showing my stomach. I love it,,,,,,
Great t-shirt but runs small. Very fit cut,,,,,,,
good, but I had a mistake when I choose the size, it is too long, it covered my hip,,,,
This is not yellow. It is beige. I like the shirt but dont order unless you want beige.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt feels great,,,,,,,
Love it,,,,,,,
Runs a tiny bit large but fast shipping and exactly what I was looking for,,,,,,,
Runs long, but happy to have senior rear covered.,,,,,,
Fitted as expected! Keeps me cool during a workout,,,,,,,
What i wanted,,,,,,,
Love it,,,,,,,
"i hate this shirt. it is NOT like my other Nike crew neck dry fit shirt.
they obviously discountinued the one i like because i cant find it anywhere.
this is not a fitted shirt. i wear a small( in a fitted shirt) this one fits baggy and loose and long.",,,,,,,
Great material and comfort,,,,,,,
ok,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,
Love it!!,,,,,,,
Very cool garment; will enjoy wearing it!,,,,,,,
I LOVE IT!,,,,,,,
Love it! Easy handling when traveling.,,,,,,,
Excellent product , highly recommended.,,,,,,
This is a nice basic workout t-shirt. It keeps you dry, fit well and is comfortable.,,,,,,
Great fit.,,,,,,,
I didnt like the quality!,,,,,,,
Love this,,,,,,,
Fits comfortably,,,,,,,
Very confortable,,,,,,,
Great top for soccer.,,,,,,,
Ok a bit long...,,,,,,,
Super large neck line,,,,,,,
I bought this shirt thinking the size would run large as thats what many of the reviews said. I did not feel that way about this shirt. I did not like the way it fit me. I am pretty broad and chesty and this shirt was definitely unflattering. It is made for very slim and petite women, not for me. I returned it immediately.,,,,,,
Bought this for my older sister as a christimas present. She loves it so much and commonly gets compliments on it! I plan on getting her a few more next christmas.,,,,,,,
Good as expected.,,,,,,,
Great feeling, rapids drying shirts. Planning a motorcycle trip and taking along a few of these. Rinse out at night and let hand dry.,,,,,,
Great fit, super comfortable, warm, but doesnt make you sweat. Its a perfect workout shirt or great for wearing under a jersey.,,,,
"I enjoy this shirt, as it works for what I intended it for. It was a little bigger than expected, bigger than many other ""Large"" shirts I have but not overly large. Its just a bit loose and a little thin, thats all. Works great though, as I use it as an undershirt in layering for the upper Midwest winters, as it can be quite cold up here. Comfortable, but it should be a bit cheaper, like $20 would be more acceptable. My main gripe is that Nike is really pushing it selling it for about $30 (for just a plain white t-shirt!) just because they can.",,,,,,,
This shirt is very nice, I bought the green one for my husband. The material is thinner but it falls and fits very nice, it does not cling. I highly recommend this shirt.,,,,,
These teet-shirts fit the way I wanted them to, for the size I thought. I have no problem ordering the way I had , thank you.,,,,,
Nice lightweight shirt. Great for working out, or wearing in the sun when you need extra coverage, but want to stay cool.,,,,,
some what too large but good quality sleeves a little too long also good quality so i gave it 3 stars no i would not buy again,,,,,,,
Great training shirt. Dont expect these to keep you warm as they are pretty thin, however they are very nice and soft and looks great. Its a somewhat fitted shirt, so make sure you dont have a tummy or it will show lol.,,,,,
My husband loves this Tee. He washes it in woolite and hang to dry. Last a long time!,,,,,,,
Comfortable, but like any other white workout shirt, will stain with sunscreen.,,,,,
My significant other was very happy with the material of this shirt and it fit perfect,,,,,,,
The sizes run smaller than most, had to return it. Sorry to say they didnt have same in larger sizes.,,,,,,
Excellent quality and price. Fit perfectly. My husband love it.,,,,,,,
Cheap quality with thin material. Not happy with what I got for the price.,,,,,,,
Warm yet cool, looks fresh and feels great. No issues, fits well.,,,,,
Needed a purple shirt. This was a great choice.,,,,,,,
Great Fit! Perfect Wash and Wear!!,,,,,,,
Son loves it. He looks good in it,,,,,,,
Great product, great seller!!!,,,,,,
Im slightly disappointed because the image I viewed appeared that the product faded from a washed out purple to a saturated purple below the shoulders. I referenced the same image while writing this review and have determined that flood lighting is creating a washed out effect on the promotional image. I used the item as a wind breaker over a sweat shirt for a team event that required a purple shirt. I will normally use it as a winter running shirt.,,,,,,,
too big not matter what size,,,,,,,
love the design and fit,,,,,,,
A little bit longer on sleeves than hope for but all in all great!,,,,,,,
nice shirt, comfy and well made,,,,,,
Looks great and fits well,,,,,,,
a gift and was loved,,,,,,,
Another satisfied customer,,,,,,,
Fits great. Extra coverage to keep the sun off during the long runs. Easy clean. Love it!,,,,,,,
Got it for our son-in-law for Christmas - he loved it and has worn it several times!,,,,,,,
Great color and size is a good fit. Happy with purchase.,,,,,,,
Fantastic product. Im absolutely in love with Nike Dri-Fit products,,,,,,,
I got this shirt as a gift for my boyfriend and he really likes it. It fits as expected and he likes that its light on him while he runs. Very timely shipping!,,,,,,,
I purchased one of these in hope of finding something that is light enough to wear and use at the gym, but still thick enough to where my nips wouldnt be popping out the whole time. Im pleased with the buy. The quality is great. Im 511 and weigh about 165-70. I went with a large and am happy i did so. Wear a tank top underneath though. If your gym is cold your nips mighy show.,,,,,,
Very good quality. Great value.,,,,,,,
Fits nice and feels good.,,,,,,,
Comfy,,,,,,,
Excellent product, price and shipping,,,,,,
Fits perfect,,,,,,,
Nice shirt. I have one in gray and now this one in white. I like the fit, i.e., not baggy, and the thinness of the fabric. Other brands are thicker, and I find that makes me too hot while exercising. Also great to wear in the sun.,,,
Bought this for my son and he loves it! Fits as expected!,,,,,,,
This is made in Mexico. The Vietnam fabric is much better.,,,,,,,
I liked this Nike long sleeve a lot.,,,,,,,
Too large,,,,,,,
Great,,,,,,,
I got the large. It looks great, however really is....welll.... quite large. I am 6 feet tall, around 200 pounds with a relatively athletic physique and this is still quite a bit too big on me. Feels more like an extra large. Insanely comfortable though and it still looks great. I would just size down if at all possible.,,,,,
I bought this shirt for longer runs (10+ miles) here in Central Florida on days when it is typically over 90 degrees and over 90% humidity. It definitely makes a difference with the white color as it is highly reflective and keeps you cooler in that regard. Secondly, you are now evaporating sweat from both your skin and the shirt, creating a better core temp cooling mechanism. I recommend.,,,,,
Super super comfortable an awesome looking but the only problem is when you order a large it comes in a slightly smaller size so its not Amazons fault, but rather Nikes for making a shirt and not giving it the proper size but overall still a great purchase and a goal to work towards,,,,,,
The long sleeves feels good but the size are a little bigger then what I ordered. I wear a medium but when I put this on, it feels and look a little bigger then medium but a little smaller then a large.,,,,,,
"Great breathable and ultra-light running shirt! The fit for the M is spot on for someone bw around 510 - 62"", with decent chest room (ie not too snug)",,,,,,,
"Comfortable dry-fit long sleeve t-shirt.
Fits well on medium frame-size.
Made in Jordan.",,,,,,,
great for the gym!,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,
Ive bought several of these. Their great to work out in or to lounge around in.,,,,,,,
bought this for a co-worker for secret santa. bought him a medium but it fits like a large. He still uses it though :) shipped and delivered on time,,,,,,,
"This was ordered for my very thin grandson. He usually wears a mens small, but this was still a bit loose in the small, but he still likes it.
",,,,,,,
100f outside and this long sleeve is keeping me cool, love thus shirt buying more,,,,,,
Fits well like to wear to the gym with my Nike Mens Free Trainer 3.0 V3 Training Shoe [Color: Game Royal/White] its a perfect match. When you running keeps the sweat under control. This way when you leave the gym you arent exposed to the cold air. I have few brands of shirts, but actually find these the most comfortable.,,,,,,
Just as you would expect. But smaller than most. Would get the next size up,,,,,,,
"Nice fit
not see through own two",,,,,,,
shirt feels very good on skin. keeps you cool and fits as expected,,,,,,,
I would recommend. Love the fit and color. No surprises here.,,,,,,,
Very good shirt made with nice expensive looking material. The shirt fits very well. I purchased the purple because most of the other colors were sold out in large. I was skeptical of the color because its purple. However, the shirt looks really good on.,,,,,,
Bought it for a Christmas gift & they loved it,,,,,,,
great shirt - fits accordingly and looks great - highly recommend,,,,,,,
"I ordered size M, its a little tight around chest, sending it back.

The material is dri-fit, very thin, but durable, not too bad for $32 I paid.",,,,,,,
A little oversized, decent quality.,,,,,,
I love this ! I would buy more!,,,,,,,
Nice color and fit,,,,,,,
Came in as red and not maroon my boyfriend ended up keeping it but now he has two of the same color,,,,,,,
Dont typically buy clothing from Amazon, but my husband has a NIKE Black long sleeve crew and wanted a white one. The size is accurate.,,,,,,
The outside tag said Large but when tried on realized it was very tight. The inside tag showed it was a small.,,,,,,,
exelent,,,,,,,
some of these run so small like they are meant for undershirts or workout only but this is a good shirt for relaxing or casual wear no form fitting,,,,,,,
I bought this lightweight dry fit for my husband to wear to the gym. He loves it. It provides extra warmth under his t shirt because our gym is always freezing cold. I bought a medium, he weighs about 165 and is 5 10 and it fits true to size.,,,,,,
great!!!,,,,,,,
Got for my father-in-law for Christmas, who usually wears a Tall, and it fit very well. He loved it so much he wore it two days in a row! LOL!,,,,,
Nice Shirt.,,,,,,,
Great fit and quality, exactly what I needed,,,,,,
Fits well throughout chest and back etc. Was expecting more of a tight fit through the arms however and wrists, however. All in all a great shirt though.,,,,,,
Great purchase. Im 62 200 pounds and ordered a large. The shirt fits great and came MUCH faster than the ETA,,,,,,,
The upper part of the sleeves are oddly baggy, while the lower forearm fits as expected. My husband isnt really a fan of it, but I think I will try to alter it so the upper arms fit more like they should.,,,,,
Great shirt for the price....Very comfortable!,,,,,,,
I was very disappointed. It was thinner and more see-through than the picture depicted. I will just use it as an undershirt on a cold day.,,,,,,,
Arrived on time and looks okay - not really impressed with the material and it had a weird smell to it when it first arrived.,,,,,,,
you can buy it at the same price outside.,,,,,,,
I bought two of these and love them. Loose fitting and lightweight. Perfect for working, hiking/camping, or just lounging around the house.,,,,,
Fits beautifully,,,,,,,
Love this shirt. Excellent for working out in or just casual wear.,,,,,,,
I have three of these all different colors. Ordered them from the same place. Fast shipping! Will buy a few more in different colors soon.,,,,,,,
"A gift for my hubby, He is 511"" 173lbs, I got him size L. It fits well.",,,,,,,
Bought it for my husband, looks And fits great,,,,,,
It was perfect just what my grandson wanted. The fit was just right, the purple was a beautiful color. Very pleased.,,,,,,
Perfect fit, great for running.,,,,,,
For some reason this fabric snags very easily on velcro. (the hook side). I have a dozen of these NikeFit that I bought years ago that dont do that.,,,,,,,
Bit larger than description.,,,,,,,
These are sized a little bigger than you would think or are used too. But the quality is still the NIKE quality. I would easy buy again.,,,,,,,
An excellent & interesting transaction,,,,,,,
Dri-Fit T-shirts are a great idea. I wear it when I play tennis in the sun to keep the sun off of my arms. It is great!,,,,,,,
I really love this as a long sleeve under shirt, under my golf polo shirts. Or can be worn as an outer shirt, its not very heavy, very light breathable material,,,,
"Great fit , exactly as described, fast delivery
I would order from this seller again",,,,,,,
My husband loves these shirts for running in the winter. Bought as a Christmas present.,,,,,,,
"I bought this t-shirt for my daughters boy friend he loved it.
Beautiful blue",,,,,,,
My husband really likes these shirts and this one is one of his favorites. Its thin enough to wear underneath a sweatshirt/fleece or to layer over a tshirt. Dri-fit material.,,,,,,,
It is great and my nephew loved it, the material was comfortable and the fit was good,,,,,,
Bought as a gift for my brother - he loves it! Stated is was comfortable and washed great. He is tall and has broad shoulders - fit great all the way around.,,,,,,,
Perfect shirt if you are running outdoors in the winter or late fall. It fits loose and is very comfortable! I would definitely reccommend this product.,,,,,,,
Great shirt, cool, nice material. Fits a littler big but is great for exercising when it is not that hot out.,,,,,
I rock one of these in a different color at least 5 days a week. Theyre legit af,,,,,,,
Arms are a bit tight where they attach to the body. Otherwise fits as expected.,,,,,,,
All perfect, thanks!!!!,,,,,,
Was not what i expected, please be careful of what the item description says and what your expectations are.,,,,,,
??,,,,,,,
Slow ship but worth the wait.,,,,,,,
I am somewhat dissapointed with how dark the color of the shirt is .,,,,,,,
Great long sleeve running shirt. Ive owned these before so no big surprise.,,,,,,,
Nike is still the best dry fit weave available, Ive bought adidas and others but they can be scratchy.,,,,,,
This shirt will get you hella chicks,,,,,,,
Too thin !Long sleeves!,,,,,,,
Fits perfectly and material is light for late spring/early fall weather in the mid-west.,,,,,,,
You get what you pay for. Very thin, badly fitting shirt,,,,,,
Fits good, but this is way light weight. In fact you can see right thought this shirt? For the price I thought it would be higher quality Nike.,,,,,,
Nice quality and good finishing as well. If you have an athletic body type this would look perfect. I use these for gym and dont feel sweaty.,,,,,,,
Bought a medium; small would probably be the right fit,,,,,,,
Fits just as expected. Im very happy with my purchase,,,,,,,
Great color,though i wish the swoosh was embroidered..,,,,,,
Ive bought several of these & they are a good look & so comfortable!,,,,,,,
"It isnt made of the same material as the ""Nike Dri-fit"". The item is also too small.
Not happy with this purchase.",,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
I was skeptical, but believe all the other reviewers now- this runs really a size or size and a half big. I usually wear a L, but this was the biggest, longest M Ive ever seen!,,,,
Fits perfectly. Feels great in the heat considering I walk all day as a letter carrier.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt, fits very good. Like the fabric. Will be good sun protection without being too hot.,,,,,,
I like the color, the fit, the weight (perfect for coolish summer days).,,,,,
Loved it!,,,,,,,
Awesome shirt and fits as expected..,,,,,,,
Loose sleeves exactly what I wanted for bug protection.,,,,,,,
Fits slightly bigger than expected, but great product. Exactly what I was looking for!,,,,,,
Light and dry feel.,,,,,,,
My husband likes this shirt a lot,,,,,,,
The material is strange. Tends to hold body odor and doesnt breathe well. Not liking it so far,,,,,,,
Grandson was very proud of it.,,,,,,,
great fit, just what i wanted,,,,,,
very nice fit true to sizing,,,,,,,
Shirt fits loosely, but is true to size.,,,,,,
Shirt was the perfect gift.,,,,,,,
Good shirt but doesnt fit as expected.,,,,,,,

Bought this as a gift for a friend at the gym. He loved it and it fits him great.,,,,,,,

A little big in the arms. My boyfriend loves it and its great quality,,,,,,,
A little tight but perfect for an under layer.,,,,,,,
Husband is very happy with this tee & I was happy with the price!,,,,,,,

Very good Dri-Fit long sleeve shirt for running in cool weather.,,,,,,,
Absolutely Perfect!!,,,,,,,
Good quality...good fit.....nice material for a trip as it is easy to clean,,,,,,,
great shirt, very comfortable and form fitting,,,,,,
These shirts are great for working out. Keeps you dry and very comfortable. I have used them for hiking in cold weather as well as an undershirt to wick sweat away.,,,,,,,
Item as described,,,,,,,
Awesome like all things Nike. The only thing is the neck line runs a little loose for my liking. A thicker seam on the neckline would make this shirt perfect.,,,,,,,
Shirt fit as expected and was the exact shade of red I wanted.,,,,,,,
Fits well, easy to wrestle in and work out in,,,,,,
fits great,,,,,,,
Great,,,,,,,

Excelent,,,,,,,
#swag,,,,,,,
good for price,,,,,,,
It fit well.,,,,,,,
Fast shipping. Exactly what i wanted,,,,,,,
Shirt fits very well, is very soft and comfortable. I ordered a few more in other colors. Good for exercising.,,,,,,
as expected,,,,,,,
fits great,,,,,,,
Ordered a size small...it was huge...and I am 5.10 and 150 LBs...,,,,,,,
Love these Nike Dri-Fit crew tops. Long sleeve or short sleeve they make for great casual shirts or workout shirts. Theyre breathable, durable, and fashionable. The heather grey color is my favorite. I bought this one to replace the one I let my friend borrow(which he has yet to return). Great product!,,,,,
My son wanted to purchase this. While I felt it was a bit overpriced, he was very happy with it. The material is very breathable.,,,,,,
Bought it for my husband. He loves these dry-fit tees and wanted this color. He was somewhat disappointed because it fit him larger than the other long sleeve dry-fit Nike tees that he has bought in the past. For future buyers, I recommend buying a size smaller.,,,,,,
Fit perfect - large as expected. Great material that dries quick.,,,,,,,
is bad,,,,,,,
I use this for golf when I go to practice and occasionally play. Feels great in Texas summers at 100+ degree heat. Usually a concern for me is how see threw the white is but I have not had that problem with this product! Am going to buy more and get a polo version as well,,,,,,,
This is a nice product, but the arms are very long compared with the body. If you need a shirt for a bigger body, but dont have particularly long arms, you may want to look at other similar products.,,,,
It doesnt feel like a Nike product. Looks like a cheap rip off.,,,,,,,
Solid shirt. I got this item for the gym but I also wear it when Im not in the gym. It is light so it is very breathable. I have a few short sleeve versions of this shirt but I think Ill be getting more of these in the future.,,,,,,,
"Really like the shirt but it definitely runs large. I am 62"" and the sleeves are long and the neck opening is larger than I would like. Really wish I had ordered a size smaller but stuck with an expensive t-shirt.",,,,,,,
Fit perfectly,,,,,,,
Very nice fit, color very true to picture and size was very accurate, my husband loved it,,,,,
The only problem I have is that I paid 30 dollars for a 28 dollar shirt. Thats what it said on the tag !! I should have looked further for a better deal !!,,,,,,,
I would advise anyone purchasing to order a size down. I ordered a medium and it looks like a large plus its a very loose material so that makes it even bigger fitting.,,,,,,,
My husband really likes this shirt however it swallows him. And the sleeves are long. Still giving 4 stars because for someone that it fits it would be perfect.,,,,,,,
This is a nice shirt for working out or casual wear. It is really thin material so can be worn in summer too. It fits nice, not super tight but like a t-shirt.,,,,,,
The shirt arrived quickly, and his extremely comfortable. I recommend this product for anyone that is interested in being comfortable while working out.,,,,,,
Everything arrived on time and in good condition. Great product for working out - exactly what I was hoping for / expected. Happy with my purchase,,,,,,,
He said its light weight very comfortable. As for me the wash, Can wear right out of dryer and its looks brand new. I bought all colors for him.,,,,,,
"The material is cheap. Not what I expected from reading the reviews. Ive bought actual Nike ""dri-fit"" from Nike and those were actually very durable and warm. This material is very thin. If you want it just for looks for the gym, I guess its ok but for its purpose -dont buy",,,,,,,
It doesnt seem authentic. It was huge. Small fit like a large. Material isnt similar to Nikes shirts.,,,,,,,
To large for me,,,,,,,
I ordered an XL and I received an XL Tall. Does not fit well at all. Product is not as described.,,,,,,,
Great it is exactly what I ordered.....great product and great price, would order more of these in the future for sure,,,,,,
The shirt was a little too big but I still use it. It works great and worth the price I paid.,,,,,,,
Excellent quality. My grandson loved it and it looked great on him. Very pleased.,,,,,,,
S Size was a bit large and wide for me in the sleeves, but still being a good product!,,,,,,
this product is very good, apart from their arrival shipping services consider them the best,,,,,,
Good fit and so far good quality to resistance to wear and tear,,,,,,,
No comment,,,,,,,
Nice Long Sleeve!,,,,,,,
great product snd customer service,,,,,,,
Its ok,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
Dont buy it. When i saw this first time in my eyes, i couldnt believe my eyes. I ordered T-shirt not dress. So I measured this stupid long bodied T-shirt, it was 29.5 inches. How can man have a body lengths of 29.5 inches? Besides the fact that i am Asian, this T-shirt is way too long.,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
I was expecting more of an under armor type of shirt. you know, tightly fit on the sleeves to show off biceps.? A bit loose on the arms and short in length of the entire shirt. fits kind of awkward for my taste. Good material though.,,,,,,
I hate the fit as that the large fits like a normal x-large. Something was wrong with the sizing.,,,,,,,
About 100% sure this shirt isnt a real Nike Dri-Fit. I own about 4 different Dri-fits and this one is counterfeit. The Nike swoosh looks and feels fake, the fabric doesnt feel like a Dri fit.,,,,,,
Excelente. Continuaré comprando a este vendedor. Tienda recomendada para hacer más compras internacionales. GRACIAS POR LA VENTA DEL PRODUCTO. SALUDOS,,,,,,,
Comfy sweater especially for work in the spring and fall,,,,,,,
I initially ordered a couple of these Nike long sleeve shirts in a couple of colors to check out the quality of the material and the workmanship. Some people had posted that the shirts were too sheer and too light for their use. All I can say is that these shirts are my new faves for working out and for wearing under quarter zip pullover shirts. I think I have ordered a total of six or seven of these shirts in various colors and I was actually contemplating ordering a few more when amazon sent an email message asking me to post a review on these shirts. The shirts are generously sized. The material is high quality and is very comfortable next to my skin, unlike some of my other long sleeve work out shirts. The workmanship is excellent. They come in a wide variety of colors. And, they are only +/- $25.00 each. Believe me, you will not be disappointed. These shirts are a great value. Enjoy... and just do it !!,,,,
This dri fit shirt is made of very very thin/fine fabric. It completely takes to the shape of your body. So unless youve got a banging body this might not be the shirt for you. The other dri fit materials are made of a hardier fabric that can kind of keep their shape. I didnt like this one because of the fit. But if youre a runner looking for a next to naked feeling dri fit shirt, this might be the shirt for you.,,,,,,
Nice shirt. I normally wear an x-lg t-shirt, so I got this in an x-lg as well, but I wish I had opted for a large. This kind of shirt wasnt meant to be this loose. My fault, though, so Im still giving it 5-stars. I guess Ill get another, but in large, and Ill just wear this one while doing yard-work or something. Id recommend you guys to consider getting a size smaller than usual.,
"Found my new favorite shirt(s) can wear it for a run or out to eat and very comfortable. Fits good 5""10 165 lbs size large (maybe a tad loose but not bad) very thin though. Nike makes a version 2.0 to this shirt that has some cotton rather than 100% poly that I like better but still love this shirt.",,,,,,,
"really low quality material for this shirt I was expecting something way better for the price and the Nike brand although Im doubting if its actually legit. The Nike logo isnt reflective neither the ""Dri-Fit"" something I found weird because if you look closely to the other shirts they say NikeFit. My chest is quite visble with this tshirt something that Im not a fan though and I used and sweated it and it doesnt dry as my other Nike or whatever other sport brand tshirt. Sadly Im not in the US otherwise Id ask for a refund.

This review isnt biased. Nobody is paying to talk about the crappy product I bought is just a customers opinion about a con over a ""Nike"" shirt. Sad

Here are some pictures of the product.",,,,,,,
"I bought this shirt b/c I wanted a long sleeve shirt to wear around the house that wasnt too warm. This works perfectly. Its light, cool, and extremely comfortable.

Regarding the size, Im 60 and weight 230. I tend to buy XXL size shirts, but on the suggestion of other reviews, I ordered an XL. The fit is perfect, which is to say that any purchasers should also consider ordering a size smaller than normal.",,,,,,,
"The fabric is thin but nice, its overall a good looking shirt, but I have to return it since it was far too large. I normally order medium (I am 5 10.5), but I ordered small (which is the smallest size available) based on the reviews. Both the shirt and the sleeves are about 1 longer than the maximum that I would tolerate. There is also a lot of extra fabric under the armpits and the shirt fits pretty loosely, so I would just order 1-2 sizes smaller if that was possible. The shirt label says ""S"", so I was sent the correct size.",,,,,,,
Very cheap shirt, not like the photo what so ever. Im not sure why so much good reviews but its the only reason I thought i was getting a nice shirt which is cheap looking shirt, the only reason for the two starts is the super fast shipping!! Not worth the money! Believe me....,,,,,
"Great shirt. Love the material and feel. I usually get a large, but purchased med because of reviews. Fits good but I like shirts to be a little more loose. Going to order a couple more but large this time. Im 510, 180.

11-16-15 I ordered 2 more. I am LE and wear under my uniform. Hold up well and very comfortable.",,,,,,,
"I bought these shirts in 2014 and my initial response to these shirts was they were fantastic. All the seams l lie flat inside and out. Fit was good felt great on so long as I only wore them short term. So for fit and quality of manufacture they would get 5 stars, but this is 2016 and I believe there are some other considerations and technologies that should be added to this type of shirt. I used these shirts as I worked maintenance for a condo and later as a pest control technician.

Having anti-odor/Anti-microbial technology made into the shirt didnt seem that important when I bought these items. However, it has to be if you need to wear a shirt made with this type of fabric longer than a few hours. When I wore these shirts under my short sleeve work shirt they became foul smelling on long hot days. I thought it might be me forgetting deodorant or something, I even carried a spare stick in my truck. After I switched to another brand with anti-odor/Anti-microbial properties I didnt have the odor issues I had with the Nike Dry Fit. So this consideration is rated by me a critical fail.

Additionally these are not advertised as having any sun protection capability, another component I need here in NW Florida. I now wear this type of shirt to play tennis to try to stay cool in the summer and get some protection from the sun to make my dermatologist happy. I want to avoid sunscreen so it doesnt mess up my grip on the racquet. After wearing these shirts for nearly a year my dermatologist treated and area in the middle of my back. Hence my renewed interest in UPF shirts. Again this area is rated by me as a critical fail.

Bottom Line: Just dont, I have to replace these Nike Dry Fit shirts to get the anti-odor/Anti-microbial and UPF 50 capabilities available in other shirts so I wasted my money on Nike. Im trying the Vapor Apparel Mens UPF Long Sleeve Solar Performance T-Shirt as a replacement.",,,,,,,
The Nike Mens Legend Poly Long Sleeve Dri-Fit T-shirt arrived within the scheduled time frame and was exactly as described on the site. It fits well, is very comfortable and I would recommend it to anyone that either works out or, wants to wear it as a long sleeved shirt under a short sleeved shirt.,,,,,
The sleeves are so long. Im 60. 165lbs. I wear an XL. The sleeves hang past my hands about 3-4 inches.,,,,,,,
"I bought this shirt from another site since it was a lot cheaper.

The shirt definitely runs large. Im 510"", 170 lbs, and usually wear mediums for Nike shirts, and they arent too loose on me. I bought a small of this shirt and it fits me very well, you could maybe even say its a little baggy, which is fine with me.

The shirt is thin, made to wear in the summer or for workouts, not the best to keep warm.

However, the shirt is very comfortable and its not too thin that you can see through it.",,,,,,,
This is a nice quality shirt, especially if you order the right size. I ordered it for my husband who is small in stature. He is 5ft. 7 and 150 pounds. I ordered a medium and it fits him very well. He loved the shirt so much that I ordered another one in Maroon. Unfortunately, they sent me the red which is why I only gave four stars as opposed to five. The only reason why I didnt send it back is because my husband decided to go ahead and keep the red even though that is not the color I wanted.,,,,,
Very nice fit and feel.Well made. Its a kind of a semi-mesh fabric that looks to be breathable. Would buy another one anytime soon. Im pleased with my purchase.,,,,,,,
"The picture of the product shows a Nike check.
Be aware the shirt may not have a Nike check.
As seen below, mine did not.",,,,,,,
"PRICED ABOVE MSRP. First thing first. These are Overpriced. This particular Nike Dri-Fit Training shirt has an MSRP of $22 (see picture of the tag from the green shirt for $22 and I paid $24 for it) and most of them listed here are going for $22-$30. That is ridiculous. You can go to Dicks Sporting Goods website and get them for $16.50. I ordered two of these shirts in red and green size XL for $23 and $24 respectively. The only reason I ordered these is because I thought they were the Dri-Fit Ts that normally retail for ~$35 and I thought I was getting a good deal. I have two of the $35 dri-fit t-shirts already, which fit really nice (not tight, I hate tight shirts, but not loose). These cheaper dri-fit t-shirts fit much larger than the $35 ones (see picture red $22 MSRP from amazon on left and navy $35 MSRP from Dicks on right, both XL). I am 63"", 230 lbs and the XL feels like I am wearing a dress.

I will be returning these shirts. I paid too much for what they actually are, and on top of that the fit is a little on the large size. There is no problem with the shirts quality wise, besides the larger fit. But if you do want one of these, do yourself a favor and dont order from here. Order it from Dicks for $16.50.",,,,,,,
"Fantastic product, the high quality stuff you expect from Nike.

Fits a tad large, but this is a performance shirt, so the idea behind it is to remove swear from the body and dry out. Dont expect this to hug at all, its meant to be a tad loose.

Awesome for warmer climates and situations where you gotta sweat but stay cool!",,,,,,,
Nice, comfortable shirt. I wear it playing tennis, jogging, boating, or just out running errands. It does seem to run a bit large, and long, but not so bad that I dont like it. I have several colors, and it is odd that they have such a wide range of prices. White was cheapest.
Im such a big fan of this running and workout shirt. It wicks moisture very well. I actually use it for hiking to keep my body cool, especially as a base layer during the spring or early fall.,,,,,,
The Nike Mens Legend shirt fit great for my son. He used it at summer camp as he was part of the purple cabin. He wore the shirt for all types of activities including game time, lunch/dinner, free time and various sporting events. The shirt did a great job wicking moisture away from his body and provided great protection from the elements. I would recommend this shirt as a great outdoor/indoor activity shirt.,,,,,
Nice fit and wears as advertised. Dri material retains slight smell after a few wears and washes. Does seem to go away after a deep soak and cleanse.,,,,,,,
Awesome and comfortable shirt! I wear when working out, playing tennis, and just around the house. Good price as well!,,,,,
This particular shirt came quite a bit larger than my other Medium Nike Dri-Fits. I noticed they were all made in different countries, so that might be the issue. Ill try and buy these shirts from local stores to make sure its the nice tight fit I was hoping for.,,,,,,
"Not yellow
It is a puke color and it was wadded up in the package
Don’t think it’s original nike",,,,,,,
Definitely great and authentic Nike quality, but a bit too large. Ordered a 2x, and its seriously huge.,,,,,
Quality is good but its extremely LARGE. Im 60 220pounds and the size large was dancing over my body,,,,,,,
Comfortable and fits well. I bought it late spring and have only worn it for a short run, but it breathed well. Would highly recommend it.,,,,,,
Purchased them for my daughter in law and she loves them. Very well made.,,,,,,,
fav longsleeve to work out it. i got the red/burgandy and always get compliments on the color,,,,,,,
Perfect Shirt, I love the high quality and it is very comfortable and light for the summer! I gave 4 stars because is a little large for me.,,,,,,
Great sports gear and my daughter loves them.,,,,,,,
It is an excellent product,,,,,,,
PERFECT ORANGE & FITS GREAT!,,,,,,,
Great looking casual shirt,,,,,,,
Very nice warm weather top for active sports.,,,,,,,
very thin fabric,,,,,,,
As noted, fit the person it was for great.,,,,,,
nice,,,,,,,
Just received the shirts and they fit as expected. Im very happy.,,,,,,,
XS is good fit but sleeves were too tight.,,,,,,,
I got this shirt today and I made the mistake to go by the size chart! Im 5ft 137lbs and according to the chart Im large but is way-way too big on me, Im returning this item.,,,,,,
I didnt realize this shirt was sheer. Super disappointed. I thought Id be able to wear it out for running errands & working out, but now I have to send it back.,,,,,,
Itchy... material not soft.,,,,,,,
Perfect for what I needed,,,,,,,
Cotton material, NOT dri-fit material. Not tight and I got an XS. Still a cute shirt but,,,,,,
Perfect,,,,,,,
I ordered a extra Large like all my others. This seems to run way small. Order up a size or two.,,,,,,,
I wear this every Monday Wednesday and Friday when I work on my upper body, it feels great! I love how it feels, I dont feel all nasty and wet and feel like my clothes is sticking to my body after Im done with my work out, not tight nice and loose, some people might not like it like that but I do, I recommend if you want it a little tight then get a size lower, I got the size I wear on my regular shirts and it was a little big but I like it like that.,
My husband loves these shirts!,,,,,,,
"The fit is good and I think for most people these would be perfect. I find I am always between sizes and this is no exception. My shoulders stick out a bit more than I would desire and the neck and arm holes are snug. I am 6 and weigh 175 43"" chest, 33"" waist so finding clothes is hard for me. Nonetheless these are high quality shirts that I will happily wear. They are a bit pricey for a sleeveless tee but they are Nike.",,,,,,,
"Fit was great, love the color, husband liked the ""muscle t"" look with the wider tank straps.",,,,,,,
super comfortable shirt,,,,,,,
Fits well and feels good,,,,,,,
Great shirt,,,,,,,
The shirt is fine but I got a medium and it is a little large. If you like your workout shirts a little looser than this is a good choice.,,,,,,,
I am very disappointed by the quality of this T shirt. It has a low quality material and does not compare to other Nike Dri-Fit clothing which we have bought in the past. After washing it once following the instructions it came out of the washer all fluffy with lots of lints on it (see the attached photo). I would not recommend buying it if you are looking for a good quality Dri-Fit T.,,,,,,,

This fits differently than my original Dri-Fit shirt, which I love. The shoulders are smaller, the material is different and a lighter weight (a little bit of see-through), and the torso is blousier. If you have broad or muscley shoulders, it will feel a bit tight. Overall weird fit for me.,,,
Seems to be cheaper material than Nikes other dry-fit shirts. A little long and loose around the waist, but I prefer that over being tight.,,,,,,
Will defiantly be replacing all my casual shirts with these in every color. Very nice material breaths well without being see through. Streatchy so very comfortable and perfect for outdoor activities and exercising drys quick exactly what it was supposed to do!,,,,,,,
I am a plus size after having a baby. I read the reviews of all those who said it ran large. I usually size up when buying online but due to those reviews I bought my usual size. This thing does not run big..,,,,,,,
The image is of a sports bra rather than of the black shirt I got for workouts.,,,,,,,
Fit really small but love the feel of the material wish it wouldve fit right,,,,,,,
"Great shirt for the gym. The M fit is somewhat loose, which I expected for the style.

Two stars because this shirt retails at $24.99 on the tag. Theyre selling at a premium.

My advice, wait until the price drops to at least $20 to get a better deal or run out to the nearest sporting goods store and buy one on sale at a retail store.",,,,,,,
I dont like to wear tight clothing when I run, but this was too big.,,,,,,
Excellent fit and the material dries fast. Great value and great design for workout or even casual wear.,,,,,,,
1.5 sizes too big but wearable. If wear a medium maybe opt for a small.,,,,,,,
Fit well and tighter than the Nike Womens Miler Short sleeve top,,,,,,,
Love this, its light weight and not clingy. I will be ordering again...,,,,,,
Comfy, however, little thick (warm) for summers,,,,,
This is more see through than the old dri-fit shirts. Its also on the large side. Im usually between a small and medium and I got the small but it was still a bit large after a few rounds in the dryer on high. Pretty color though and seems like its made well.,,,,,,,
"i dont know what happened but I bought 2 dry-fit T shirts size L (I have one M and it is a little tight thats why I bought L), but what I received wasnt what I expected. I had to give them to my husband and they fit them ok.
I am in argentina so I cant sned them back.
It was a waste of money.",,,,,,,
Niceeee nicceeee shirt,,,,,,,
Love Nike gear,,,,,,,
good quality,,,,,,,
Good shirt!,,,,,,,
Not even the same shirt that was shown! The purple is actually a dark pinkish color not a deep purple like what is in the images and description. It doesnt have the nike logo on the front and it has mesh on the back and sides. Not at all what was shown in the pictures.,,,,,,,
The color. Was not what the web site showed.,,,,,,,
Great Shirt,,,,,,,
Arrived quickly and great price!,,,,,,,
Ordered the Royal blue . Its much much brighter than the picture. Also ordered an XS and is still too big. Cannot wear it for this race.,,,,,,,
Nice color,,,,,,,
Nice color - if you are looking for a fitted look this is not the shirt - I wear a medium and its a little big - but the small would have been to small,,,,,,,
Wonderful shirt! Looks great and feels better. My daughter typically wears a womens small to med.so we hot small and its still loose,,,,,,,
Love this shirt!! I use it for my gym workouts, very comfortable and goes with everything.,,,,,,
Nice fit and very light,,,,,,,
It was larger than I expected. I should have ordered a small one for next time. But overall its comfortable for workout so Im happy with it.,,,,,,,
I received this shirt the day after I ordered it! And then ordered it in another color because of how perfect it is,,,,,,,
I love this material. When I work out and wear this shirt I dont feel like it weighs me down when I sweat,,,,,,,
Nothing like last years Legend Tee which fit better and I liked the material better.,,,,,,,
Great condition,,,,,,,
Fits great, nice material!,,,,,,
Its bit large but I like that for my jiu jitsu class.. Good buy and fast delivery,,,,,,,
very bad quality......the logo not white,its gray logo......its exist in local market by 3 usd,,,,,,
You can find a better product fot that price, too expensive and not that great,,,,,,
Very nice,,,,,,,
Excellent fit! Quality fabric. Love the color. Holds up to frequent washing and drying. Couldnt be happier.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt!,,,,,,,
Perfect cut. Not too tight but has a feminine, not boxy, cut. Love it.,,,,,
Color is not as shown, fit is loose.,,,,,,
Wish it was just a bit bigger in width. But it is just what I wanted for looks. Very comfortable. I have washed it and it did not shrink.,,,,,,,
Perfect, it was a gift, She loved it,,,,,
Color is it even close to what is pictured. Its is not a bright gold/yellow.. its a dull tan/pale gold color,,,,,,,
This shirt is the only shirt I use for exercising. I have five of them and love them. The fit is perfect.,,,,,,,
perfect fit,,,,,,,
It wasnt as nice as the one with the same name (DriFit) purchased in a store; its a very thin material.,,,,,,,
Clearly not a real small!,,,,,,,
Great fit, true to size,,,,,,
arrived in time for Christmas. Fit perfectly.,,,,,,,
Arrived on time and exactly as described.,,,,,,,
Thinner than some of my other Nike tops but a good length. I would buy again!,,,,,,,
Fits my wife perfectly. Looks great and keeps you cool on hot days!,,,,,,,
Grandaughter loves it !,,,,,,,
Great length and light weight. True to color,,,,,,,
The fit was as expected. Im very happy with this shirt. Its soft, thick enough to not see through and long enough so I can go through airport security and raise my arms without showing my stomach. I love it,,,,,,
Great t-shirt but runs small. Very fit cut,,,,,,,
good, but I had a mistake when I choose the size, it is too long, it covered my hip,,,,
This is not yellow. It is beige. I like the shirt but dont order unless you want beige.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt feels great,,,,,,,
Love it,,,,,,,
Runs a tiny bit large but fast shipping and exactly what I was looking for,,,,,,,
Runs long, but happy to have senior rear covered.,,,,,,
Fitted as expected! Keeps me cool during a workout,,,,,,,
What i wanted,,,,,,,
Love it,,,,,,,
"i hate this shirt. it is NOT like my other Nike crew neck dry fit shirt.
they obviously discountinued the one i like because i cant find it anywhere.
this is not a fitted shirt. i wear a small( in a fitted shirt) this one fits baggy and loose and long.",,,,,,,
Great material and comfort,,,,,,,
ok,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,
Love it!!,,,,,,,
Very cool garment; will enjoy wearing it!,,,,,,,
I LOVE IT!,,,,,,,
Love it! Easy handling when traveling.,,,,,,,
Excellent product , highly recommended.,,,,,,
This is a nice basic workout t-shirt. It keeps you dry, fit well and is comfortable.,,,,,,
Great fit.,,,,,,,
I didnt like the quality!,,,,,,,
Love this,,,,,,,
Fits comfortably,,,,,,,
Very confortable,,,,,,,
Great top for soccer.,,,,,,,
Ok a bit long...,,,,,,,
Super large neck line,,,,,,,
I bought this shirt thinking the size would run large as thats what many of the reviews said. I did not feel that way about this shirt. I did not like the way it fit me. I am pretty broad and chesty and this shirt was definitely unflattering. It is made for very slim and petite women, not for me. I returned it immediately.,,,,,,
Bought this for my older sister as a christimas present. She loves it so much and commonly gets compliments on it! I plan on getting her a few more next christmas.,,,,,,,
Good as expected.,,,,,,,
Great feeling, rapids drying shirts. Planning a motorcycle trip and taking along a few of these. Rinse out at night and let hand dry.,,,,,,
Great fit, super comfortable, warm, but doesnt make you sweat. Its a perfect workout shirt or great for wearing under a jersey.,,,,
"I enjoy this shirt, as it works for what I intended it for. It was a little bigger than expected, bigger than many other ""Large"" shirts I have but not overly large. Its just a bit loose and a little thin, thats all. Works great though, as I use it as an undershirt in layering for the upper Midwest winters, as it can be quite cold up here. Comfortable, but it should be a bit cheaper, like $20 would be more acceptable. My main gripe is that Nike is really pushing it selling it for about $30 (for just a plain white t-shirt!) just because they can.",,,,,,,
This shirt is very nice, I bought the green one for my husband. The material is thinner but it falls and fits very nice, it does not cling. I highly recommend this shirt.,,,,,
These teet-shirts fit the way I wanted them to, for the size I thought. I have no problem ordering the way I had , thank you.,,,,,
Nice lightweight shirt. Great for working out, or wearing in the sun when you need extra coverage, but want to stay cool.,,,,,
some what too large but good quality sleeves a little too long also good quality so i gave it 3 stars no i would not buy again,,,,,,,
Great training shirt. Dont expect these to keep you warm as they are pretty thin, however they are very nice and soft and looks great. Its a somewhat fitted shirt, so make sure you dont have a tummy or it will show lol.,,,,,
My husband loves this Tee. He washes it in woolite and hang to dry. Last a long time!,,,,,,,
Comfortable, but like any other white workout shirt, will stain with sunscreen.,,,,,
My significant other was very happy with the material of this shirt and it fit perfect,,,,,,,
The sizes run smaller than most, had to return it. Sorry to say they didnt have same in larger sizes.,,,,,,
Excellent quality and price. Fit perfectly. My husband love it.,,,,,,,
Cheap quality with thin material. Not happy with what I got for the price.,,,,,,,
Warm yet cool, looks fresh and feels great. No issues, fits well.,,,,,
Needed a purple shirt. This was a great choice.,,,,,,,
Great Fit! Perfect Wash and Wear!!,,,,,,,
Son loves it. He looks good in it,,,,,,,
Great product, great seller!!!,,,,,,
Im slightly disappointed because the image I viewed appeared that the product faded from a washed out purple to a saturated purple below the shoulders. I referenced the same image while writing this review and have determined that flood lighting is creating a washed out effect on the promotional image. I used the item as a wind breaker over a sweat shirt for a team event that required a purple shirt. I will normally use it as a winter running shirt.,,,,,,,
too big not matter what size,,,,,,,
love the design and fit,,,,,,,
A little bit longer on sleeves than hope for but all in all great!,,,,,,,
nice shirt, comfy and well made,,,,,,
Looks great and fits well,,,,,,,
a gift and was loved,,,,,,,
Another satisfied customer,,,,,,,
Fits great. Extra coverage to keep the sun off during the long runs. Easy clean. Love it!,,,,,,,
Got it for our son-in-law for Christmas - he loved it and has worn it several times!,,,,,,,
Great color and size is a good fit. Happy with purchase.,,,,,,,
Fantastic product. Im absolutely in love with Nike Dri-Fit products,,,,,,,
I got this shirt as a gift for my boyfriend and he really likes it. It fits as expected and he likes that its light on him while he runs. Very timely shipping!,,,,,,,
I purchased one of these in hope of finding something that is light enough to wear and use at the gym, but still thick enough to where my nips wouldnt be popping out the whole time. Im pleased with the buy. The quality is great. Im 511 and weigh about 165-70. I went with a large and am happy i did so. Wear a tank top underneath though. If your gym is cold your nips mighy show.,,,,,,
Very good quality. Great value.,,,,,,,
Fits nice and feels good.,,,,,,,
Comfy,,,,,,,
Excellent product, price and shipping,,,,,,
Fits perfect,,,,,,,
Nice shirt. I have one in gray and now this one in white. I like the fit, i.e., not baggy, and the thinness of the fabric. Other brands are thicker, and I find that makes me too hot while exercising. Also great to wear in the sun.,,,
Bought this for my son and he loves it! Fits as expected!,,,,,,,
This is made in Mexico. The Vietnam fabric is much better.,,,,,,,
I liked this Nike long sleeve a lot.,,,,,,,
Too large,,,,,,,
Great,,,,,,,
I got the large. It looks great, however really is....welll.... quite large. I am 6 feet tall, around 200 pounds with a relatively athletic physique and this is still quite a bit too big on me. Feels more like an extra large. Insanely comfortable though and it still looks great. I would just size down if at all possible.,,,,,
I bought this shirt for longer runs (10+ miles) here in Central Florida on days when it is typically over 90 degrees and over 90% humidity. It definitely makes a difference with the white color as it is highly reflective and keeps you cooler in that regard. Secondly, you are now evaporating sweat from both your skin and the shirt, creating a better core temp cooling mechanism. I recommend.,,,,,
Super super comfortable an awesome looking but the only problem is when you order a large it comes in a slightly smaller size so its not Amazons fault, but rather Nikes for making a shirt and not giving it the proper size but overall still a great purchase and a goal to work towards,,,,,,
The long sleeves feels good but the size are a little bigger then what I ordered. I wear a medium but when I put this on, it feels and look a little bigger then medium but a little smaller then a large.,,,,,,
"Great breathable and ultra-light running shirt! The fit for the M is spot on for someone bw around 510 - 62"", with decent chest room (ie not too snug)",,,,,,,
"Comfortable dry-fit long sleeve t-shirt.
Fits well on medium frame-size.
Made in Jordan.",,,,,,,
great for the gym!,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,
Ive bought several of these. Their great to work out in or to lounge around in.,,,,,,,
bought this for a co-worker for secret santa. bought him a medium but it fits like a large. He still uses it though :) shipped and delivered on time,,,,,,,
"This was ordered for my very thin grandson. He usually wears a mens small, but this was still a bit loose in the small, but he still likes it.
",,,,,,,
100f outside and this long sleeve is keeping me cool, love thus shirt buying more,,,,,,
Fits well like to wear to the gym with my Nike Mens Free Trainer 3.0 V3 Training Shoe [Color: Game Royal/White] its a perfect match. When you running keeps the sweat under control. This way when you leave the gym you arent exposed to the cold air. I have few brands of shirts, but actually find these the most comfortable.,,,,,,
Just as you would expect. But smaller than most. Would get the next size up,,,,,,,
"Nice fit
not see through own two",,,,,,,
shirt feels very good on skin. keeps you cool and fits as expected,,,,,,,
I would recommend. Love the fit and color. No surprises here.,,,,,,,
Very good shirt made with nice expensive looking material. The shirt fits very well. I purchased the purple because most of the other colors were sold out in large. I was skeptical of the color because its purple. However, the shirt looks really good on.,,,,,,
Bought it for a Christmas gift & they loved it,,,,,,,
great shirt - fits accordingly and looks great - highly recommend,,,,,,,
"I ordered size M, its a little tight around chest, sending it back.

The material is dri-fit, very thin, but durable, not too bad for $32 I paid.",,,,,,,
A little oversized, decent quality.,,,,,,
I love this ! I would buy more!,,,,,,,
Nice color and fit,,,,,,,
Came in as red and not maroon my boyfriend ended up keeping it but now he has two of the same color,,,,,,,
Dont typically buy clothing from Amazon, but my husband has a NIKE Black long sleeve crew and wanted a white one. The size is accurate.,,,,,,
The outside tag said Large but when tried on realized it was very tight. The inside tag showed it was a small.,,,,,,,
exelent,,,,,,,
some of these run so small like they are meant for undershirts or workout only but this is a good shirt for relaxing or casual wear no form fitting,,,,,,,
I bought this lightweight dry fit for my husband to wear to the gym. He loves it. It provides extra warmth under his t shirt because our gym is always freezing cold. I bought a medium, he weighs about 165 and is 5 10 and it fits true to size.,,,,,,
great!!!,,,,,,,
Got for my father-in-law for Christmas, who usually wears a Tall, and it fit very well. He loved it so much he wore it two days in a row! LOL!,,,,,
Nice Shirt.,,,,,,,
Great fit and quality, exactly what I needed,,,,,,
Fits well throughout chest and back etc. Was expecting more of a tight fit through the arms however and wrists, however. All in all a great shirt though.,,,,,,
Great purchase. Im 62 200 pounds and ordered a large. The shirt fits great and came MUCH faster than the ETA,,,,,,,
The upper part of the sleeves are oddly baggy, while the lower forearm fits as expected. My husband isnt really a fan of it, but I think I will try to alter it so the upper arms fit more like they should.,,,,,
Great shirt for the price....Very comfortable!,,,,,,,
I was very disappointed. It was thinner and more see-through than the picture depicted. I will just use it as an undershirt on a cold day.,,,,,,,
Arrived on time and looks okay - not really impressed with the material and it had a weird smell to it when it first arrived.,,,,,,,
you can buy it at the same price outside.,,,,,,,
I bought two of these and love them. Loose fitting and lightweight. Perfect for working, hiking/camping, or just lounging around the house.,,,,,
Fits beautifully,,,,,,,
Love this shirt. Excellent for working out in or just casual wear.,,,,,,,
I have three of these all different colors. Ordered them from the same place. Fast shipping! Will buy a few more in different colors soon.,,,,,,,
"A gift for my hubby, He is 511"" 173lbs, I got him size L. It fits well.",,,,,,,
Bought it for my husband, looks And fits great,,,,,,
It was perfect just what my grandson wanted. The fit was just right, the purple was a beautiful color. Very pleased.,,,,,,
Perfect fit, great for running.,,,,,,
For some reason this fabric snags very easily on velcro. (the hook side). I have a dozen of these NikeFit that I bought years ago that dont do that.,,,,,,,
Bit larger than description.,,,,,,,
These are sized a little bigger than you would think or are used too. But the quality is still the NIKE quality. I would easy buy again.,,,,,,,
An excellent & interesting transaction,,,,,,,
Dri-Fit T-shirts are a great idea. I wear it when I play tennis in the sun to keep the sun off of my arms. It is great!,,,,,,,
I really love this as a long sleeve under shirt, under my golf polo shirts. Or can be worn as an outer shirt, its not very heavy, very light breathable material,,,,
"Great fit , exactly as described, fast delivery
I would order from this seller again",,,,,,,
My husband loves these shirts for running in the winter. Bought as a Christmas present.,,,,,,,
"I bought this t-shirt for my daughters boy friend he loved it.
Beautiful blue",,,,,,,
My husband really likes these shirts and this one is one of his favorites. Its thin enough to wear underneath a sweatshirt/fleece or to layer over a tshirt. Dri-fit material.,,,,,,,
It is great and my nephew loved it, the material was comfortable and the fit was good,,,,,,
Bought as a gift for my brother - he loves it! Stated is was comfortable and washed great. He is tall and has broad shoulders - fit great all the way around.,,,,,,,
Perfect shirt if you are running outdoors in the winter or late fall. It fits loose and is very comfortable! I would definitely reccommend this product.,,,,,,,
Great shirt, cool, nice material. Fits a littler big but is great for exercising when it is not that hot out.,,,,,
I rock one of these in a different color at least 5 days a week. Theyre legit af,,,,,,,
Arms are a bit tight where they attach to the body. Otherwise fits as expected.,,,,,,,
All perfect, thanks!!!!,,,,,,
Was not what i expected, please be careful of what the item description says and what your expectations are.,,,,,,
??,,,,,,,
Slow ship but worth the wait.,,,,,,,
I am somewhat dissapointed with how dark the color of the shirt is .,,,,,,,
Great long sleeve running shirt. Ive owned these before so no big surprise.,,,,,,,
Nike is still the best dry fit weave available, Ive bought adidas and others but they can be scratchy.,,,,,,
This shirt will get you hella chicks,,,,,,,
Too thin !Long sleeves!,,,,,,,
Fits perfectly and material is light for late spring/early fall weather in the mid-west.,,,,,,,
You get what you pay for. Very thin, badly fitting shirt,,,,,,
Fits good, but this is way light weight. In fact you can see right thought this shirt? For the price I thought it would be higher quality Nike.,,,,,,
Nice quality and good finishing as well. If you have an athletic body type this would look perfect. I use these for gym and dont feel sweaty.,,,,,,,
Bought a medium; small would probably be the right fit,,,,,,,
Fits just as expected. Im very happy with my purchase,,,,,,,
Great color,though i wish the swoosh was embroidered..,,,,,,
Ive bought several of these & they are a good look & so comfortable!,,,,,,,
"It isnt made of the same material as the ""Nike Dri-fit"". The item is also too small.
Not happy with this purchase.",,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
I was skeptical, but believe all the other reviewers now- this runs really a size or size and a half big. I usually wear a L, but this was the biggest, longest M Ive ever seen!,,,,
Fits perfectly. Feels great in the heat considering I walk all day as a letter carrier.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt, fits very good. Like the fabric. Will be good sun protection without being too hot.,,,,,,
I like the color, the fit, the weight (perfect for coolish summer days).,,,,,
Loved it!,,,,,,,
Awesome shirt and fits as expected..,,,,,,,
Loose sleeves exactly what I wanted for bug protection.,,,,,,,
Fits slightly bigger than expected, but great product. Exactly what I was looking for!,,,,,,
Light and dry feel.,,,,,,,
My husband likes this shirt a lot,,,,,,,
The material is strange. Tends to hold body odor and doesnt breathe well. Not liking it so far,,,,,,,
Grandson was very proud of it.,,,,,,,
great fit, just what i wanted,,,,,,
very nice fit true to sizing,,,,,,,
Shirt fits loosely, but is true to size.,,,,,,
Shirt was the perfect gift.,,,,,,,
Good shirt but doesnt fit as expected.,,,,,,,

Bought this as a gift for a friend at the gym. He loved it and it fits him great.,,,,,,,
very comfortable shirt.,,,,,,,
Great shirt. Love it!,,,,,,,
Its a nice shirt, but it was for my 13 year old son and it almost fits my husband who wears a large.,,,,,,

A little tight but perfect for an under layer.,,,,,,,

Great shirt.,,,,,,,

I purchased for travel. Stores well in the suit case and is comfortable for travel or by the pool. You cant go wrong.,,,,,,,

Very good Dri-Fit long sleeve shirt for running in cool weather.,,,,,,,
Absolutely Perfect!!,,,,,,,
Good quality...good fit.....nice material for a trip as it is easy to clean,,,,,,,
great shirt, very comfortable and form fitting,,,,,,
These shirts are great for working out. Keeps you dry and very comfortable. I have used them for hiking in cold weather as well as an undershirt to wick sweat away.,,,,,,,
Item as described,,,,,,,
Awesome like all things Nike. The only thing is the neck line runs a little loose for my liking. A thicker seam on the neckline would make this shirt perfect.,,,,,,,
Shirt fit as expected and was the exact shade of red I wanted.,,,,,,,
Fits well, easy to wrestle in and work out in,,,,,,
fits great,,,,,,,
Great,,,,,,,
Good shirt!,,,,,,,

Just right,,,,,,,
The shirt fits perfect and the price is alot cheaper than in a store!!,,,,,,,

thx,,,,,,,
Great fit; light weight .Perfect to work out in which was just what he wanted.,,,,,,,
This shirt is great for warming up, light workouts, or running outside/on the treadmill. It fits really well, and is thin so it is very breathable.,,,,
Extraordinarily thin material. Maybe thats the way it is supposed to be.,,,,,,,
Very good,,,,,,,
thank you,,,,,,,

Excelent,,,,,,,
#swag,,,,,,,
good for price,,,,,,,
It fit well.,,,,,,,
Fast shipping. Exactly what i wanted,,,,,,,
Shirt fits very well, is very soft and comfortable. I ordered a few more in other colors. Good for exercising.,,,,,,
as expected,,,,,,,
fits great,,,,,,,
Ordered a size small...it was huge...and I am 5.10 and 150 LBs...,,,,,,,
Love these Nike Dri-Fit crew tops. Long sleeve or short sleeve they make for great casual shirts or workout shirts. Theyre breathable, durable, and fashionable. The heather grey color is my favorite. I bought this one to replace the one I let my friend borrow(which he has yet to return). Great product!,,,,,
My son wanted to purchase this. While I felt it was a bit overpriced, he was very happy with it. The material is very breathable.,,,,,,
Bought it for my husband. He loves these dry-fit tees and wanted this color. He was somewhat disappointed because it fit him larger than the other long sleeve dry-fit Nike tees that he has bought in the past. For future buyers, I recommend buying a size smaller.,,,,,,
Fit perfect - large as expected. Great material that dries quick.,,,,,,,
is bad,,,,,,,
I use this for golf when I go to practice and occasionally play. Feels great in Texas summers at 100+ degree heat. Usually a concern for me is how see threw the white is but I have not had that problem with this product! Am going to buy more and get a polo version as well,,,,,,,
This is a nice product, but the arms are very long compared with the body. If you need a shirt for a bigger body, but dont have particularly long arms, you may want to look at other similar products.,,,,
It doesnt feel like a Nike product. Looks like a cheap rip off.,,,,,,,
Solid shirt. I got this item for the gym but I also wear it when Im not in the gym. It is light so it is very breathable. I have a few short sleeve versions of this shirt but I think Ill be getting more of these in the future.,,,,,,,
"Really like the shirt but it definitely runs large. I am 62"" and the sleeves are long and the neck opening is larger than I would like. Really wish I had ordered a size smaller but stuck with an expensive t-shirt.",,,,,,,
Fit perfectly,,,,,,,
Very nice fit, color very true to picture and size was very accurate, my husband loved it,,,,,
The only problem I have is that I paid 30 dollars for a 28 dollar shirt. Thats what it said on the tag !! I should have looked further for a better deal !!,,,,,,,
I would advise anyone purchasing to order a size down. I ordered a medium and it looks like a large plus its a very loose material so that makes it even bigger fitting.,,,,,,,
My husband really likes this shirt however it swallows him. And the sleeves are long. Still giving 4 stars because for someone that it fits it would be perfect.,,,,,,,
This is a nice shirt for working out or casual wear. It is really thin material so can be worn in summer too. It fits nice, not super tight but like a t-shirt.,,,,,,
The shirt arrived quickly, and his extremely comfortable. I recommend this product for anyone that is interested in being comfortable while working out.,,,,,,
Everything arrived on time and in good condition. Great product for working out - exactly what I was hoping for / expected. Happy with my purchase,,,,,,,
He said its light weight very comfortable. As for me the wash, Can wear right out of dryer and its looks brand new. I bought all colors for him.,,,,,,
"The material is cheap. Not what I expected from reading the reviews. Ive bought actual Nike ""dri-fit"" from Nike and those were actually very durable and warm. This material is very thin. If you want it just for looks for the gym, I guess its ok but for its purpose -dont buy",,,,,,,
It doesnt seem authentic. It was huge. Small fit like a large. Material isnt similar to Nikes shirts.,,,,,,,
To large for me,,,,,,,
I ordered an XL and I received an XL Tall. Does not fit well at all. Product is not as described.,,,,,,,
Great it is exactly what I ordered.....great product and great price, would order more of these in the future for sure,,,,,,
The shirt was a little too big but I still use it. It works great and worth the price I paid.,,,,,,,
Excellent quality. My grandson loved it and it looked great on him. Very pleased.,,,,,,,
S Size was a bit large and wide for me in the sleeves, but still being a good product!,,,,,,
this product is very good, apart from their arrival shipping services consider them the best,,,,,,
Good fit and so far good quality to resistance to wear and tear,,,,,,,
No comment,,,,,,,
Nice Long Sleeve!,,,,,,,
great product snd customer service,,,,,,,
Its ok,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
Dont buy it. When i saw this first time in my eyes, i couldnt believe my eyes. I ordered T-shirt not dress. So I measured this stupid long bodied T-shirt, it was 29.5 inches. How can man have a body lengths of 29.5 inches? Besides the fact that i am Asian, this T-shirt is way too long.,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
I was expecting more of an under armor type of shirt. you know, tightly fit on the sleeves to show off biceps.? A bit loose on the arms and short in length of the entire shirt. fits kind of awkward for my taste. Good material though.,,,,,,
I hate the fit as that the large fits like a normal x-large. Something was wrong with the sizing.,,,,,,,
About 100% sure this shirt isnt a real Nike Dri-Fit. I own about 4 different Dri-fits and this one is counterfeit. The Nike swoosh looks and feels fake, the fabric doesnt feel like a Dri fit.,,,,,,
Excelente. Continuaré comprando a este vendedor. Tienda recomendada para hacer más compras internacionales. GRACIAS POR LA VENTA DEL PRODUCTO. SALUDOS,,,,,,,
Comfy sweater especially for work in the spring and fall,,,,,,,
I initially ordered a couple of these Nike long sleeve shirts in a couple of colors to check out the quality of the material and the workmanship. Some people had posted that the shirts were too sheer and too light for their use. All I can say is that these shirts are my new faves for working out and for wearing under quarter zip pullover shirts. I think I have ordered a total of six or seven of these shirts in various colors and I was actually contemplating ordering a few more when amazon sent an email message asking me to post a review on these shirts. The shirts are generously sized. The material is high quality and is very comfortable next to my skin, unlike some of my other long sleeve work out shirts. The workmanship is excellent. They come in a wide variety of colors. And, they are only +/- $25.00 each. Believe me, you will not be disappointed. These shirts are a great value. Enjoy... and just do it !!,,,,
This dri fit shirt is made of very very thin/fine fabric. It completely takes to the shape of your body. So unless youve got a banging body this might not be the shirt for you. The other dri fit materials are made of a hardier fabric that can kind of keep their shape. I didnt like this one because of the fit. But if youre a runner looking for a next to naked feeling dri fit shirt, this might be the shirt for you.,,,,,,
Nice shirt. I normally wear an x-lg t-shirt, so I got this in an x-lg as well, but I wish I had opted for a large. This kind of shirt wasnt meant to be this loose. My fault, though, so Im still giving it 5-stars. I guess Ill get another, but in large, and Ill just wear this one while doing yard-work or something. Id recommend you guys to consider getting a size smaller than usual.,
"Found my new favorite shirt(s) can wear it for a run or out to eat and very comfortable. Fits good 5""10 165 lbs size large (maybe a tad loose but not bad) very thin though. Nike makes a version 2.0 to this shirt that has some cotton rather than 100% poly that I like better but still love this shirt.",,,,,,,
"really low quality material for this shirt I was expecting something way better for the price and the Nike brand although Im doubting if its actually legit. The Nike logo isnt reflective neither the ""Dri-Fit"" something I found weird because if you look closely to the other shirts they say NikeFit. My chest is quite visble with this tshirt something that Im not a fan though and I used and sweated it and it doesnt dry as my other Nike or whatever other sport brand tshirt. Sadly Im not in the US otherwise Id ask for a refund.

This review isnt biased. Nobody is paying to talk about the crappy product I bought is just a customers opinion about a con over a ""Nike"" shirt. Sad

Here are some pictures of the product.",,,,,,,
"I bought this shirt b/c I wanted a long sleeve shirt to wear around the house that wasnt too warm. This works perfectly. Its light, cool, and extremely comfortable.

Regarding the size, Im 60 and weight 230. I tend to buy XXL size shirts, but on the suggestion of other reviews, I ordered an XL. The fit is perfect, which is to say that any purchasers should also consider ordering a size smaller than normal.",,,,,,,
"The fabric is thin but nice, its overall a good looking shirt, but I have to return it since it was far too large. I normally order medium (I am 5 10.5), but I ordered small (which is the smallest size available) based on the reviews. Both the shirt and the sleeves are about 1 longer than the maximum that I would tolerate. There is also a lot of extra fabric under the armpits and the shirt fits pretty loosely, so I would just order 1-2 sizes smaller if that was possible. The shirt label says ""S"", so I was sent the correct size.",,,,,,,
Very cheap shirt, not like the photo what so ever. Im not sure why so much good reviews but its the only reason I thought i was getting a nice shirt which is cheap looking shirt, the only reason for the two starts is the super fast shipping!! Not worth the money! Believe me....,,,,,
"Great shirt. Love the material and feel. I usually get a large, but purchased med because of reviews. Fits good but I like shirts to be a little more loose. Going to order a couple more but large this time. Im 510, 180.

11-16-15 I ordered 2 more. I am LE and wear under my uniform. Hold up well and very comfortable.",,,,,,,
"I bought these shirts in 2014 and my initial response to these shirts was they were fantastic. All the seams l lie flat inside and out. Fit was good felt great on so long as I only wore them short term. So for fit and quality of manufacture they would get 5 stars, but this is 2016 and I believe there are some other considerations and technologies that should be added to this type of shirt. I used these shirts as I worked maintenance for a condo and later as a pest control technician.

Having anti-odor/Anti-microbial technology made into the shirt didnt seem that important when I bought these items. However, it has to be if you need to wear a shirt made with this type of fabric longer than a few hours. When I wore these shirts under my short sleeve work shirt they became foul smelling on long hot days. I thought it might be me forgetting deodorant or something, I even carried a spare stick in my truck. After I switched to another brand with anti-odor/Anti-microbial properties I didnt have the odor issues I had with the Nike Dry Fit. So this consideration is rated by me a critical fail.

Additionally these are not advertised as having any sun protection capability, another component I need here in NW Florida. I now wear this type of shirt to play tennis to try to stay cool in the summer and get some protection from the sun to make my dermatologist happy. I want to avoid sunscreen so it doesnt mess up my grip on the racquet. After wearing these shirts for nearly a year my dermatologist treated and area in the middle of my back. Hence my renewed interest in UPF shirts. Again this area is rated by me as a critical fail.

Bottom Line: Just dont, I have to replace these Nike Dry Fit shirts to get the anti-odor/Anti-microbial and UPF 50 capabilities available in other shirts so I wasted my money on Nike. Im trying the Vapor Apparel Mens UPF Long Sleeve Solar Performance T-Shirt as a replacement.",,,,,,,
The Nike Mens Legend Poly Long Sleeve Dri-Fit T-shirt arrived within the scheduled time frame and was exactly as described on the site. It fits well, is very comfortable and I would recommend it to anyone that either works out or, wants to wear it as a long sleeved shirt under a short sleeved shirt.,,,,,
The sleeves are so long. Im 60. 165lbs. I wear an XL. The sleeves hang past my hands about 3-4 inches.,,,,,,,
"I bought this shirt from another site since it was a lot cheaper.

The shirt definitely runs large. Im 510"", 170 lbs, and usually wear mediums for Nike shirts, and they arent too loose on me. I bought a small of this shirt and it fits me very well, you could maybe even say its a little baggy, which is fine with me.

The shirt is thin, made to wear in the summer or for workouts, not the best to keep warm.

However, the shirt is very comfortable and its not too thin that you can see through it.",,,,,,,
This is a nice quality shirt, especially if you order the right size. I ordered it for my husband who is small in stature. He is 5ft. 7 and 150 pounds. I ordered a medium and it fits him very well. He loved the shirt so much that I ordered another one in Maroon. Unfortunately, they sent me the red which is why I only gave four stars as opposed to five. The only reason why I didnt send it back is because my husband decided to go ahead and keep the red even though that is not the color I wanted.,,,,,
Very nice fit and feel.Well made. Its a kind of a semi-mesh fabric that looks to be breathable. Would buy another one anytime soon. Im pleased with my purchase.,,,,,,,
"The picture of the product shows a Nike check.
Be aware the shirt may not have a Nike check.
As seen below, mine did not.",,,,,,,
"PRICED ABOVE MSRP. First thing first. These are Overpriced. This particular Nike Dri-Fit Training shirt has an MSRP of $22 (see picture of the tag from the green shirt for $22 and I paid $24 for it) and most of them listed here are going for $22-$30. That is ridiculous. You can go to Dicks Sporting Goods website and get them for $16.50. I ordered two of these shirts in red and green size XL for $23 and $24 respectively. The only reason I ordered these is because I thought they were the Dri-Fit Ts that normally retail for ~$35 and I thought I was getting a good deal. I have two of the $35 dri-fit t-shirts already, which fit really nice (not tight, I hate tight shirts, but not loose). These cheaper dri-fit t-shirts fit much larger than the $35 ones (see picture red $22 MSRP from amazon on left and navy $35 MSRP from Dicks on right, both XL). I am 63"", 230 lbs and the XL feels like I am wearing a dress.

I will be returning these shirts. I paid too much for what they actually are, and on top of that the fit is a little on the large size. There is no problem with the shirts quality wise, besides the larger fit. But if you do want one of these, do yourself a favor and dont order from here. Order it from Dicks for $16.50.",,,,,,,
"Fantastic product, the high quality stuff you expect from Nike.

Fits a tad large, but this is a performance shirt, so the idea behind it is to remove swear from the body and dry out. Dont expect this to hug at all, its meant to be a tad loose.

Awesome for warmer climates and situations where you gotta sweat but stay cool!",,,,,,,
Nice, comfortable shirt. I wear it playing tennis, jogging, boating, or just out running errands. It does seem to run a bit large, and long, but not so bad that I dont like it. I have several colors, and it is odd that they have such a wide range of prices. White was cheapest.
Im such a big fan of this running and workout shirt. It wicks moisture very well. I actually use it for hiking to keep my body cool, especially as a base layer during the spring or early fall.,,,,,,
The Nike Mens Legend shirt fit great for my son. He used it at summer camp as he was part of the purple cabin. He wore the shirt for all types of activities including game time, lunch/dinner, free time and various sporting events. The shirt did a great job wicking moisture away from his body and provided great protection from the elements. I would recommend this shirt as a great outdoor/indoor activity shirt.,,,,,
Nice fit and wears as advertised. Dri material retains slight smell after a few wears and washes. Does seem to go away after a deep soak and cleanse.,,,,,,,
Awesome and comfortable shirt! I wear when working out, playing tennis, and just around the house. Good price as well!,,,,,
This particular shirt came quite a bit larger than my other Medium Nike Dri-Fits. I noticed they were all made in different countries, so that might be the issue. Ill try and buy these shirts from local stores to make sure its the nice tight fit I was hoping for.,,,,,,
"Not yellow
It is a puke color and it was wadded up in the package
Don’t think it’s original nike",,,,,,,
Definitely great and authentic Nike quality, but a bit too large. Ordered a 2x, and its seriously huge.,,,,,
Quality is good but its extremely LARGE. Im 60 220pounds and the size large was dancing over my body,,,,,,,
Comfortable and fits well. I bought it late spring and have only worn it for a short run, but it breathed well. Would highly recommend it.,,,,,,
Purchased them for my daughter in law and she loves them. Very well made.,,,,,,,
fav longsleeve to work out it. i got the red/burgandy and always get compliments on the color,,,,,,,
Perfect Shirt, I love the high quality and it is very comfortable and light for the summer! I gave 4 stars because is a little large for me.,,,,,,
Great sports gear and my daughter loves them.,,,,,,,
It is an excellent product,,,,,,,
PERFECT ORANGE & FITS GREAT!,,,,,,,
Great looking casual shirt,,,,,,,
Very nice warm weather top for active sports.,,,,,,,
very thin fabric,,,,,,,
As noted, fit the person it was for great.,,,,,,
nice,,,,,,,
Just received the shirts and they fit as expected. Im very happy.,,,,,,,
XS is good fit but sleeves were too tight.,,,,,,,
I got this shirt today and I made the mistake to go by the size chart! Im 5ft 137lbs and according to the chart Im large but is way-way too big on me, Im returning this item.,,,,,,
I didnt realize this shirt was sheer. Super disappointed. I thought Id be able to wear it out for running errands & working out, but now I have to send it back.,,,,,,
Itchy... material not soft.,,,,,,,
Perfect for what I needed,,,,,,,
Cotton material, NOT dri-fit material. Not tight and I got an XS. Still a cute shirt but,,,,,,
Perfect,,,,,,,
I ordered a extra Large like all my others. This seems to run way small. Order up a size or two.,,,,,,,
I wear this every Monday Wednesday and Friday when I work on my upper body, it feels great! I love how it feels, I dont feel all nasty and wet and feel like my clothes is sticking to my body after Im done with my work out, not tight nice and loose, some people might not like it like that but I do, I recommend if you want it a little tight then get a size lower, I got the size I wear on my regular shirts and it was a little big but I like it like that.,
My husband loves these shirts!,,,,,,,
"The fit is good and I think for most people these would be perfect. I find I am always between sizes and this is no exception. My shoulders stick out a bit more than I would desire and the neck and arm holes are snug. I am 6 and weigh 175 43"" chest, 33"" waist so finding clothes is hard for me. Nonetheless these are high quality shirts that I will happily wear. They are a bit pricey for a sleeveless tee but they are Nike.",,,,,,,
"Fit was great, love the color, husband liked the ""muscle t"" look with the wider tank straps.",,,,,,,
super comfortable shirt,,,,,,,
Fits well and feels good,,,,,,,
Great shirt,,,,,,,
The shirt is fine but I got a medium and it is a little large. If you like your workout shirts a little looser than this is a good choice.,,,,,,,
I am very disappointed by the quality of this T shirt. It has a low quality material and does not compare to other Nike Dri-Fit clothing which we have bought in the past. After washing it once following the instructions it came out of the washer all fluffy with lots of lints on it (see the attached photo). I would not recommend buying it if you are looking for a good quality Dri-Fit T.,,,,,,,

This fits differently than my original Dri-Fit shirt, which I love. The shoulders are smaller, the material is different and a lighter weight (a little bit of see-through), and the torso is blousier. If you have broad or muscley shoulders, it will feel a bit tight. Overall weird fit for me.,,,
Seems to be cheaper material than Nikes other dry-fit shirts. A little long and loose around the waist, but I prefer that over being tight.,,,,,,
Will defiantly be replacing all my casual shirts with these in every color. Very nice material breaths well without being see through. Streatchy so very comfortable and perfect for outdoor activities and exercising drys quick exactly what it was supposed to do!,,,,,,,
I am a plus size after having a baby. I read the reviews of all those who said it ran large. I usually size up when buying online but due to those reviews I bought my usual size. This thing does not run big..,,,,,,,
The image is of a sports bra rather than of the black shirt I got for workouts.,,,,,,,
Fit really small but love the feel of the material wish it wouldve fit right,,,,,,,
"Great shirt for the gym. The M fit is somewhat loose, which I expected for the style.

Two stars because this shirt retails at $24.99 on the tag. Theyre selling at a premium.

My advice, wait until the price drops to at least $20 to get a better deal or run out to the nearest sporting goods store and buy one on sale at a retail store.",,,,,,,
I dont like to wear tight clothing when I run, but this was too big.,,,,,,
Excellent fit and the material dries fast. Great value and great design for workout or even casual wear.,,,,,,,
1.5 sizes too big but wearable. If wear a medium maybe opt for a small.,,,,,,,
Fit well and tighter than the Nike Womens Miler Short sleeve top,,,,,,,
Love this, its light weight and not clingy. I will be ordering again...,,,,,,
Comfy, however, little thick (warm) for summers,,,,,
This is more see through than the old dri-fit shirts. Its also on the large side. Im usually between a small and medium and I got the small but it was still a bit large after a few rounds in the dryer on high. Pretty color though and seems like its made well.,,,,,,,
"i dont know what happened but I bought 2 dry-fit T shirts size L (I have one M and it is a little tight thats why I bought L), but what I received wasnt what I expected. I had to give them to my husband and they fit them ok.
I am in argentina so I cant sned them back.
It was a waste of money.",,,,,,,
Niceeee nicceeee shirt,,,,,,,
Love Nike gear,,,,,,,
good quality,,,,,,,
Good shirt!,,,,,,,
Not even the same shirt that was shown! The purple is actually a dark pinkish color not a deep purple like what is in the images and description. It doesnt have the nike logo on the front and it has mesh on the back and sides. Not at all what was shown in the pictures.,,,,,,,
The color. Was not what the web site showed.,,,,,,,
Great Shirt,,,,,,,
Arrived quickly and great price!,,,,,,,
Ordered the Royal blue . Its much much brighter than the picture. Also ordered an XS and is still too big. Cannot wear it for this race.,,,,,,,
Nice color,,,,,,,
Nice color - if you are looking for a fitted look this is not the shirt - I wear a medium and its a little big - but the small would have been to small,,,,,,,
Wonderful shirt! Looks great and feels better. My daughter typically wears a womens small to med.so we hot small and its still loose,,,,,,,
Love this shirt!! I use it for my gym workouts, very comfortable and goes with everything.,,,,,,
Nice fit and very light,,,,,,,
It was larger than I expected. I should have ordered a small one for next time. But overall its comfortable for workout so Im happy with it.,,,,,,,
I received this shirt the day after I ordered it! And then ordered it in another color because of how perfect it is,,,,,,,
I love this material. When I work out and wear this shirt I dont feel like it weighs me down when I sweat,,,,,,,
Nothing like last years Legend Tee which fit better and I liked the material better.,,,,,,,
Great condition,,,,,,,
Fits great, nice material!,,,,,,
Its bit large but I like that for my jiu jitsu class.. Good buy and fast delivery,,,,,,,
very bad quality......the logo not white,its gray logo......its exist in local market by 3 usd,,,,,,
You can find a better product fot that price, too expensive and not that great,,,,,,
Very nice,,,,,,,
Excellent fit! Quality fabric. Love the color. Holds up to frequent washing and drying. Couldnt be happier.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt!,,,,,,,
Perfect cut. Not too tight but has a feminine, not boxy, cut. Love it.,,,,,
Color is not as shown, fit is loose.,,,,,,
Wish it was just a bit bigger in width. But it is just what I wanted for looks. Very comfortable. I have washed it and it did not shrink.,,,,,,,
Perfect, it was a gift, She loved it,,,,,
Color is it even close to what is pictured. Its is not a bright gold/yellow.. its a dull tan/pale gold color,,,,,,,
This shirt is the only shirt I use for exercising. I have five of them and love them. The fit is perfect.,,,,,,,
perfect fit,,,,,,,
It wasnt as nice as the one with the same name (DriFit) purchased in a store; its a very thin material.,,,,,,,
Clearly not a real small!,,,,,,,
Great fit, true to size,,,,,,
arrived in time for Christmas. Fit perfectly.,,,,,,,
Arrived on time and exactly as described.,,,,,,,
Thinner than some of my other Nike tops but a good length. I would buy again!,,,,,,,
Fits my wife perfectly. Looks great and keeps you cool on hot days!,,,,,,,
Grandaughter loves it !,,,,,,,
Great length and light weight. True to color,,,,,,,
The fit was as expected. Im very happy with this shirt. Its soft, thick enough to not see through and long enough so I can go through airport security and raise my arms without showing my stomach. I love it,,,,,,
Great t-shirt but runs small. Very fit cut,,,,,,,
good, but I had a mistake when I choose the size, it is too long, it covered my hip,,,,
This is not yellow. It is beige. I like the shirt but dont order unless you want beige.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt feels great,,,,,,,
Love it,,,,,,,
Runs a tiny bit large but fast shipping and exactly what I was looking for,,,,,,,
Runs long, but happy to have senior rear covered.,,,,,,
Fitted as expected! Keeps me cool during a workout,,,,,,,
What i wanted,,,,,,,
Love it,,,,,,,
"i hate this shirt. it is NOT like my other Nike crew neck dry fit shirt.
they obviously discountinued the one i like because i cant find it anywhere.
this is not a fitted shirt. i wear a small( in a fitted shirt) this one fits baggy and loose and long.",,,,,,,
Great material and comfort,,,,,,,
ok,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,
Love it!!,,,,,,,
Very cool garment; will enjoy wearing it!,,,,,,,
I LOVE IT!,,,,,,,
Love it! Easy handling when traveling.,,,,,,,
Excellent product , highly recommended.,,,,,,
This is a nice basic workout t-shirt. It keeps you dry, fit well and is comfortable.,,,,,,
Great fit.,,,,,,,
I didnt like the quality!,,,,,,,
Love this,,,,,,,
Fits comfortably,,,,,,,
Very confortable,,,,,,,
Great top for soccer.,,,,,,,
Ok a bit long...,,,,,,,
Super large neck line,,,,,,,
I bought this shirt thinking the size would run large as thats what many of the reviews said. I did not feel that way about this shirt. I did not like the way it fit me. I am pretty broad and chesty and this shirt was definitely unflattering. It is made for very slim and petite women, not for me. I returned it immediately.,,,,,,
Bought this for my older sister as a christimas present. She loves it so much and commonly gets compliments on it! I plan on getting her a few more next christmas.,,,,,,,
Good as expected.,,,,,,,
Great feeling, rapids drying shirts. Planning a motorcycle trip and taking along a few of these. Rinse out at night and let hand dry.,,,,,,
Great fit, super comfortable, warm, but doesnt make you sweat. Its a perfect workout shirt or great for wearing under a jersey.,,,,
"I enjoy this shirt, as it works for what I intended it for. It was a little bigger than expected, bigger than many other ""Large"" shirts I have but not overly large. Its just a bit loose and a little thin, thats all. Works great though, as I use it as an undershirt in layering for the upper Midwest winters, as it can be quite cold up here. Comfortable, but it should be a bit cheaper, like $20 would be more acceptable. My main gripe is that Nike is really pushing it selling it for about $30 (for just a plain white t-shirt!) just because they can.",,,,,,,
This shirt is very nice, I bought the green one for my husband. The material is thinner but it falls and fits very nice, it does not cling. I highly recommend this shirt.,,,,,
These teet-shirts fit the way I wanted them to, for the size I thought. I have no problem ordering the way I had , thank you.,,,,,
Nice lightweight shirt. Great for working out, or wearing in the sun when you need extra coverage, but want to stay cool.,,,,,
some what too large but good quality sleeves a little too long also good quality so i gave it 3 stars no i would not buy again,,,,,,,
Great training shirt. Dont expect these to keep you warm as they are pretty thin, however they are very nice and soft and looks great. Its a somewhat fitted shirt, so make sure you dont have a tummy or it will show lol.,,,,,
My husband loves this Tee. He washes it in woolite and hang to dry. Last a long time!,,,,,,,
Comfortable, but like any other white workout shirt, will stain with sunscreen.,,,,,
My significant other was very happy with the material of this shirt and it fit perfect,,,,,,,
The sizes run smaller than most, had to return it. Sorry to say they didnt have same in larger sizes.,,,,,,
Excellent quality and price. Fit perfectly. My husband love it.,,,,,,,
Cheap quality with thin material. Not happy with what I got for the price.,,,,,,,
Warm yet cool, looks fresh and feels great. No issues, fits well.,,,,,
Needed a purple shirt. This was a great choice.,,,,,,,
Great Fit! Perfect Wash and Wear!!,,,,,,,
Son loves it. He looks good in it,,,,,,,
Great product, great seller!!!,,,,,,
Im slightly disappointed because the image I viewed appeared that the product faded from a washed out purple to a saturated purple below the shoulders. I referenced the same image while writing this review and have determined that flood lighting is creating a washed out effect on the promotional image. I used the item as a wind breaker over a sweat shirt for a team event that required a purple shirt. I will normally use it as a winter running shirt.,,,,,,,
too big not matter what size,,,,,,,
love the design and fit,,,,,,,
A little bit longer on sleeves than hope for but all in all great!,,,,,,,
nice shirt, comfy and well made,,,,,,
Looks great and fits well,,,,,,,
a gift and was loved,,,,,,,
Another satisfied customer,,,,,,,
Fits great. Extra coverage to keep the sun off during the long runs. Easy clean. Love it!,,,,,,,
Got it for our son-in-law for Christmas - he loved it and has worn it several times!,,,,,,,
Great color and size is a good fit. Happy with purchase.,,,,,,,
Fantastic product. Im absolutely in love with Nike Dri-Fit products,,,,,,,
I got this shirt as a gift for my boyfriend and he really likes it. It fits as expected and he likes that its light on him while he runs. Very timely shipping!,,,,,,,
I purchased one of these in hope of finding something that is light enough to wear and use at the gym, but still thick enough to where my nips wouldnt be popping out the whole time. Im pleased with the buy. The quality is great. Im 511 and weigh about 165-70. I went with a large and am happy i did so. Wear a tank top underneath though. If your gym is cold your nips mighy show.,,,,,,
Very good quality. Great value.,,,,,,,
Fits nice and feels good.,,,,,,,
Comfy,,,,,,,
Excellent product, price and shipping,,,,,,
Fits perfect,,,,,,,
Nice shirt. I have one in gray and now this one in white. I like the fit, i.e., not baggy, and the thinness of the fabric. Other brands are thicker, and I find that makes me too hot while exercising. Also great to wear in the sun.,,,
Bought this for my son and he loves it! Fits as expected!,,,,,,,
This is made in Mexico. The Vietnam fabric is much better.,,,,,,,
I liked this Nike long sleeve a lot.,,,,,,,
Too large,,,,,,,
Great,,,,,,,
I got the large. It looks great, however really is....welll.... quite large. I am 6 feet tall, around 200 pounds with a relatively athletic physique and this is still quite a bit too big on me. Feels more like an extra large. Insanely comfortable though and it still looks great. I would just size down if at all possible.,,,,,
I bought this shirt for longer runs (10+ miles) here in Central Florida on days when it is typically over 90 degrees and over 90% humidity. It definitely makes a difference with the white color as it is highly reflective and keeps you cooler in that regard. Secondly, you are now evaporating sweat from both your skin and the shirt, creating a better core temp cooling mechanism. I recommend.,,,,,
Super super comfortable an awesome looking but the only problem is when you order a large it comes in a slightly smaller size so its not Amazons fault, but rather Nikes for making a shirt and not giving it the proper size but overall still a great purchase and a goal to work towards,,,,,,
The long sleeves feels good but the size are a little bigger then what I ordered. I wear a medium but when I put this on, it feels and look a little bigger then medium but a little smaller then a large.,,,,,,
"Great breathable and ultra-light running shirt! The fit for the M is spot on for someone bw around 510 - 62"", with decent chest room (ie not too snug)",,,,,,,
"Comfortable dry-fit long sleeve t-shirt.
Fits well on medium frame-size.
Made in Jordan.",,,,,,,
great for the gym!,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,
Ive bought several of these. Their great to work out in or to lounge around in.,,,,,,,
bought this for a co-worker for secret santa. bought him a medium but it fits like a large. He still uses it though :) shipped and delivered on time,,,,,,,
"This was ordered for my very thin grandson. He usually wears a mens small, but this was still a bit loose in the small, but he still likes it.
",,,,,,,
100f outside and this long sleeve is keeping me cool, love thus shirt buying more,,,,,,
Fits well like to wear to the gym with my Nike Mens Free Trainer 3.0 V3 Training Shoe [Color: Game Royal/White] its a perfect match. When you running keeps the sweat under control. This way when you leave the gym you arent exposed to the cold air. I have few brands of shirts, but actually find these the most comfortable.,,,,,,
Just as you would expect. But smaller than most. Would get the next size up,,,,,,,
"Nice fit
not see through own two",,,,,,,
shirt feels very good on skin. keeps you cool and fits as expected,,,,,,,
I would recommend. Love the fit and color. No surprises here.,,,,,,,
Very good shirt made with nice expensive looking material. The shirt fits very well. I purchased the purple because most of the other colors were sold out in large. I was skeptical of the color because its purple. However, the shirt looks really good on.,,,,,,
Bought it for a Christmas gift & they loved it,,,,,,,
great shirt - fits accordingly and looks great - highly recommend,,,,,,,
"I ordered size M, its a little tight around chest, sending it back.

The material is dri-fit, very thin, but durable, not too bad for $32 I paid.",,,,,,,
A little oversized, decent quality.,,,,,,
I love this ! I would buy more!,,,,,,,
Nice color and fit,,,,,,,
Came in as red and not maroon my boyfriend ended up keeping it but now he has two of the same color,,,,,,,
Dont typically buy clothing from Amazon, but my husband has a NIKE Black long sleeve crew and wanted a white one. The size is accurate.,,,,,,
The outside tag said Large but when tried on realized it was very tight. The inside tag showed it was a small.,,,,,,,
exelent,,,,,,,
some of these run so small like they are meant for undershirts or workout only but this is a good shirt for relaxing or casual wear no form fitting,,,,,,,
I bought this lightweight dry fit for my husband to wear to the gym. He loves it. It provides extra warmth under his t shirt because our gym is always freezing cold. I bought a medium, he weighs about 165 and is 5 10 and it fits true to size.,,,,,,
great!!!,,,,,,,
Got for my father-in-law for Christmas, who usually wears a Tall, and it fit very well. He loved it so much he wore it two days in a row! LOL!,,,,,
Nice Shirt.,,,,,,,
Great fit and quality, exactly what I needed,,,,,,
Fits well throughout chest and back etc. Was expecting more of a tight fit through the arms however and wrists, however. All in all a great shirt though.,,,,,,
Great purchase. Im 62 200 pounds and ordered a large. The shirt fits great and came MUCH faster than the ETA,,,,,,,
The upper part of the sleeves are oddly baggy, while the lower forearm fits as expected. My husband isnt really a fan of it, but I think I will try to alter it so the upper arms fit more like they should.,,,,,
Great shirt for the price....Very comfortable!,,,,,,,
I was very disappointed. It was thinner and more see-through than the picture depicted. I will just use it as an undershirt on a cold day.,,,,,,,
Arrived on time and looks okay - not really impressed with the material and it had a weird smell to it when it first arrived.,,,,,,,
you can buy it at the same price outside.,,,,,,,
I bought two of these and love them. Loose fitting and lightweight. Perfect for working, hiking/camping, or just lounging around the house.,,,,,
Fits beautifully,,,,,,,
Love this shirt. Excellent for working out in or just casual wear.,,,,,,,
I have three of these all different colors. Ordered them from the same place. Fast shipping! Will buy a few more in different colors soon.,,,,,,,
"A gift for my hubby, He is 511"" 173lbs, I got him size L. It fits well.",,,,,,,
Bought it for my husband, looks And fits great,,,,,,
It was perfect just what my grandson wanted. The fit was just right, the purple was a beautiful color. Very pleased.,,,,,,
Perfect fit, great for running.,,,,,,
For some reason this fabric snags very easily on velcro. (the hook side). I have a dozen of these NikeFit that I bought years ago that dont do that.,,,,,,,
Bit larger than description.,,,,,,,
These are sized a little bigger than you would think or are used too. But the quality is still the NIKE quality. I would easy buy again.,,,,,,,
An excellent & interesting transaction,,,,,,,
Dri-Fit T-shirts are a great idea. I wear it when I play tennis in the sun to keep the sun off of my arms. It is great!,,,,,,,
I really love this as a long sleeve under shirt, under my golf polo shirts. Or can be worn as an outer shirt, its not very heavy, very light breathable material,,,,
"Great fit , exactly as described, fast delivery
I would order from this seller again",,,,,,,
My husband loves these shirts for running in the winter. Bought as a Christmas present.,,,,,,,
"I bought this t-shirt for my daughters boy friend he loved it.
Beautiful blue",,,,,,,
My husband really likes these shirts and this one is one of his favorites. Its thin enough to wear underneath a sweatshirt/fleece or to layer over a tshirt. Dri-fit material.,,,,,,,
It is great and my nephew loved it, the material was comfortable and the fit was good,,,,,,
Bought as a gift for my brother - he loves it! Stated is was comfortable and washed great. He is tall and has broad shoulders - fit great all the way around.,,,,,,,
Perfect shirt if you are running outdoors in the winter or late fall. It fits loose and is very comfortable! I would definitely reccommend this product.,,,,,,,
Great shirt, cool, nice material. Fits a littler big but is great for exercising when it is not that hot out.,,,,,
I rock one of these in a different color at least 5 days a week. Theyre legit af,,,,,,,
Arms are a bit tight where they attach to the body. Otherwise fits as expected.,,,,,,,
All perfect, thanks!!!!,,,,,,
Was not what i expected, please be careful of what the item description says and what your expectations are.,,,,,,
??,,,,,,,
Slow ship but worth the wait.,,,,,,,
I am somewhat dissapointed with how dark the color of the shirt is .,,,,,,,
Great long sleeve running shirt. Ive owned these before so no big surprise.,,,,,,,
Nike is still the best dry fit weave available, Ive bought adidas and others but they can be scratchy.,,,,,,
This shirt will get you hella chicks,,,,,,,
Too thin !Long sleeves!,,,,,,,
Fits perfectly and material is light for late spring/early fall weather in the mid-west.,,,,,,,
You get what you pay for. Very thin, badly fitting shirt,,,,,,
Fits good, but this is way light weight. In fact you can see right thought this shirt? For the price I thought it would be higher quality Nike.,,,,,,
Nice quality and good finishing as well. If you have an athletic body type this would look perfect. I use these for gym and dont feel sweaty.,,,,,,,
Bought a medium; small would probably be the right fit,,,,,,,
Fits just as expected. Im very happy with my purchase,,,,,,,
Great color,though i wish the swoosh was embroidered..,,,,,,
Ive bought several of these & they are a good look & so comfortable!,,,,,,,
"It isnt made of the same material as the ""Nike Dri-fit"". The item is also too small.
Not happy with this purchase.",,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
I was skeptical, but believe all the other reviewers now- this runs really a size or size and a half big. I usually wear a L, but this was the biggest, longest M Ive ever seen!,,,,
Fits perfectly. Feels great in the heat considering I walk all day as a letter carrier.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt, fits very good. Like the fabric. Will be good sun protection without being too hot.,,,,,,
I like the color, the fit, the weight (perfect for coolish summer days).,,,,,
Loved it!,,,,,,,
Awesome shirt and fits as expected..,,,,,,,
Loose sleeves exactly what I wanted for bug protection.,,,,,,,
Fits slightly bigger than expected, but great product. Exactly what I was looking for!,,,,,,
Light and dry feel.,,,,,,,
My husband likes this shirt a lot,,,,,,,
The material is strange. Tends to hold body odor and doesnt breathe well. Not liking it so far,,,,,,,
Grandson was very proud of it.,,,,,,,
great fit, just what i wanted,,,,,,
very nice fit true to sizing,,,,,,,
Shirt fits loosely, but is true to size.,,,,,,
Shirt was the perfect gift.,,,,,,,
Good shirt but doesnt fit as expected.,,,,,,,
like it wont buy again was charge shipping should have been free my order said 1 of 2 on this order ps who can i contact on this ?,,,,,,,
Bought this as a gift for a friend at the gym. He loved it and it fits him great.,,,,,,,
very comfortable shirt.,,,,,,,
Great shirt. Love it!,,,,,,,

Very good Dri-Fit long sleeve shirt for running in cool weather.,,,,,,,
Absolutely Perfect!!,,,,,,,
Good quality...good fit.....nice material for a trip as it is easy to clean,,,,,,,
great shirt, very comfortable and form fitting,,,,,,
These shirts are great for working out. Keeps you dry and very comfortable. I have used them for hiking in cold weather as well as an undershirt to wick sweat away.,,,,,,,
Item as described,,,,,,,
Awesome like all things Nike. The only thing is the neck line runs a little loose for my liking. A thicker seam on the neckline would make this shirt perfect.,,,,,,,
Shirt fit as expected and was the exact shade of red I wanted.,,,,,,,
Fits well, easy to wrestle in and work out in,,,,,,
fits great,,,,,,,

Just right,,,,,,,
The shirt fits perfect and the price is alot cheaper than in a store!!,,,,,,,
awesome,,,,,,,
thx,,,,,,,
Great fit; light weight .Perfect to work out in which was just what he wanted.,,,,,,,
This shirt is great for warming up, light workouts, or running outside/on the treadmill. It fits really well, and is thin so it is very breathable.,,,,
Extraordinarily thin material. Maybe thats the way it is supposed to be.,,,,,,,
Very good,,,,,,,

#swag,,,,,,,

It fit well.,,,,,,,
Fast shipping. Exactly what i wanted,,,,,,,
Shirt fits very well, is very soft and comfortable. I ordered a few more in other colors. Good for exercising.,,,,,,
as expected,,,,,,,
fits great,,,,,,,
Ordered a size small...it was huge...and I am 5.10 and 150 LBs...,,,,,,,
Love these Nike Dri-Fit crew tops. Long sleeve or short sleeve they make for great casual shirts or workout shirts. Theyre breathable, durable, and fashionable. The heather grey color is my favorite. I bought this one to replace the one I let my friend borrow(which he has yet to return). Great product!,,,,,
My son wanted to purchase this. While I felt it was a bit overpriced, he was very happy with it. The material is very breathable.,,,,,,
Bought it for my husband. He loves these dry-fit tees and wanted this color. He was somewhat disappointed because it fit him larger than the other long sleeve dry-fit Nike tees that he has bought in the past. For future buyers, I recommend buying a size smaller.,,,,,,
Fit perfect - large as expected. Great material that dries quick.,,,,,,,
is bad,,,,,,,
I use this for golf when I go to practice and occasionally play. Feels great in Texas summers at 100+ degree heat. Usually a concern for me is how see threw the white is but I have not had that problem with this product! Am going to buy more and get a polo version as well,,,,,,,
This is a nice product, but the arms are very long compared with the body. If you need a shirt for a bigger body, but dont have particularly long arms, you may want to look at other similar products.,,,,
It doesnt feel like a Nike product. Looks like a cheap rip off.,,,,,,,
Solid shirt. I got this item for the gym but I also wear it when Im not in the gym. It is light so it is very breathable. I have a few short sleeve versions of this shirt but I think Ill be getting more of these in the future.,,,,,,,
"Really like the shirt but it definitely runs large. I am 62"" and the sleeves are long and the neck opening is larger than I would like. Really wish I had ordered a size smaller but stuck with an expensive t-shirt.",,,,,,,
Fit perfectly,,,,,,,
Very nice fit, color very true to picture and size was very accurate, my husband loved it,,,,,
The only problem I have is that I paid 30 dollars for a 28 dollar shirt. Thats what it said on the tag !! I should have looked further for a better deal !!,,,,,,,
I would advise anyone purchasing to order a size down. I ordered a medium and it looks like a large plus its a very loose material so that makes it even bigger fitting.,,,,,,,
My husband really likes this shirt however it swallows him. And the sleeves are long. Still giving 4 stars because for someone that it fits it would be perfect.,,,,,,,
This is a nice shirt for working out or casual wear. It is really thin material so can be worn in summer too. It fits nice, not super tight but like a t-shirt.,,,,,,
The shirt arrived quickly, and his extremely comfortable. I recommend this product for anyone that is interested in being comfortable while working out.,,,,,,
Everything arrived on time and in good condition. Great product for working out - exactly what I was hoping for / expected. Happy with my purchase,,,,,,,
He said its light weight very comfortable. As for me the wash, Can wear right out of dryer and its looks brand new. I bought all colors for him.,,,,,,
"The material is cheap. Not what I expected from reading the reviews. Ive bought actual Nike ""dri-fit"" from Nike and those were actually very durable and warm. This material is very thin. If you want it just for looks for the gym, I guess its ok but for its purpose -dont buy",,,,,,,
It doesnt seem authentic. It was huge. Small fit like a large. Material isnt similar to Nikes shirts.,,,,,,,
To large for me,,,,,,,
I ordered an XL and I received an XL Tall. Does not fit well at all. Product is not as described.,,,,,,,
Great it is exactly what I ordered.....great product and great price, would order more of these in the future for sure,,,,,,
The shirt was a little too big but I still use it. It works great and worth the price I paid.,,,,,,,
Excellent quality. My grandson loved it and it looked great on him. Very pleased.,,,,,,,
S Size was a bit large and wide for me in the sleeves, but still being a good product!,,,,,,
this product is very good, apart from their arrival shipping services consider them the best,,,,,,
Good fit and so far good quality to resistance to wear and tear,,,,,,,
No comment,,,,,,,
Nice Long Sleeve!,,,,,,,
great product snd customer service,,,,,,,
Its ok,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
Dont buy it. When i saw this first time in my eyes, i couldnt believe my eyes. I ordered T-shirt not dress. So I measured this stupid long bodied T-shirt, it was 29.5 inches. How can man have a body lengths of 29.5 inches? Besides the fact that i am Asian, this T-shirt is way too long.,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
I was expecting more of an under armor type of shirt. you know, tightly fit on the sleeves to show off biceps.? A bit loose on the arms and short in length of the entire shirt. fits kind of awkward for my taste. Good material though.,,,,,,
I hate the fit as that the large fits like a normal x-large. Something was wrong with the sizing.,,,,,,,
About 100% sure this shirt isnt a real Nike Dri-Fit. I own about 4 different Dri-fits and this one is counterfeit. The Nike swoosh looks and feels fake, the fabric doesnt feel like a Dri fit.,,,,,,
Excelente. Continuaré comprando a este vendedor. Tienda recomendada para hacer más compras internacionales. GRACIAS POR LA VENTA DEL PRODUCTO. SALUDOS,,,,,,,
Comfy sweater especially for work in the spring and fall,,,,,,,
I initially ordered a couple of these Nike long sleeve shirts in a couple of colors to check out the quality of the material and the workmanship. Some people had posted that the shirts were too sheer and too light for their use. All I can say is that these shirts are my new faves for working out and for wearing under quarter zip pullover shirts. I think I have ordered a total of six or seven of these shirts in various colors and I was actually contemplating ordering a few more when amazon sent an email message asking me to post a review on these shirts. The shirts are generously sized. The material is high quality and is very comfortable next to my skin, unlike some of my other long sleeve work out shirts. The workmanship is excellent. They come in a wide variety of colors. And, they are only +/- $25.00 each. Believe me, you will not be disappointed. These shirts are a great value. Enjoy... and just do it !!,,,,
This dri fit shirt is made of very very thin/fine fabric. It completely takes to the shape of your body. So unless youve got a banging body this might not be the shirt for you. The other dri fit materials are made of a hardier fabric that can kind of keep their shape. I didnt like this one because of the fit. But if youre a runner looking for a next to naked feeling dri fit shirt, this might be the shirt for you.,,,,,,
Nice shirt. I normally wear an x-lg t-shirt, so I got this in an x-lg as well, but I wish I had opted for a large. This kind of shirt wasnt meant to be this loose. My fault, though, so Im still giving it 5-stars. I guess Ill get another, but in large, and Ill just wear this one while doing yard-work or something. Id recommend you guys to consider getting a size smaller than usual.,
"Found my new favorite shirt(s) can wear it for a run or out to eat and very comfortable. Fits good 5""10 165 lbs size large (maybe a tad loose but not bad) very thin though. Nike makes a version 2.0 to this shirt that has some cotton rather than 100% poly that I like better but still love this shirt.",,,,,,,
"really low quality material for this shirt I was expecting something way better for the price and the Nike brand although Im doubting if its actually legit. The Nike logo isnt reflective neither the ""Dri-Fit"" something I found weird because if you look closely to the other shirts they say NikeFit. My chest is quite visble with this tshirt something that Im not a fan though and I used and sweated it and it doesnt dry as my other Nike or whatever other sport brand tshirt. Sadly Im not in the US otherwise Id ask for a refund.

This review isnt biased. Nobody is paying to talk about the crappy product I bought is just a customers opinion about a con over a ""Nike"" shirt. Sad

Here are some pictures of the product.",,,,,,,
"I bought this shirt b/c I wanted a long sleeve shirt to wear around the house that wasnt too warm. This works perfectly. Its light, cool, and extremely comfortable.

Regarding the size, Im 60 and weight 230. I tend to buy XXL size shirts, but on the suggestion of other reviews, I ordered an XL. The fit is perfect, which is to say that any purchasers should also consider ordering a size smaller than normal.",,,,,,,
"The fabric is thin but nice, its overall a good looking shirt, but I have to return it since it was far too large. I normally order medium (I am 5 10.5), but I ordered small (which is the smallest size available) based on the reviews. Both the shirt and the sleeves are about 1 longer than the maximum that I would tolerate. There is also a lot of extra fabric under the armpits and the shirt fits pretty loosely, so I would just order 1-2 sizes smaller if that was possible. The shirt label says ""S"", so I was sent the correct size.",,,,,,,
Very cheap shirt, not like the photo what so ever. Im not sure why so much good reviews but its the only reason I thought i was getting a nice shirt which is cheap looking shirt, the only reason for the two starts is the super fast shipping!! Not worth the money! Believe me....,,,,,
"Great shirt. Love the material and feel. I usually get a large, but purchased med because of reviews. Fits good but I like shirts to be a little more loose. Going to order a couple more but large this time. Im 510, 180.

11-16-15 I ordered 2 more. I am LE and wear under my uniform. Hold up well and very comfortable.",,,,,,,
"I bought these shirts in 2014 and my initial response to these shirts was they were fantastic. All the seams l lie flat inside and out. Fit was good felt great on so long as I only wore them short term. So for fit and quality of manufacture they would get 5 stars, but this is 2016 and I believe there are some other considerations and technologies that should be added to this type of shirt. I used these shirts as I worked maintenance for a condo and later as a pest control technician.

Having anti-odor/Anti-microbial technology made into the shirt didnt seem that important when I bought these items. However, it has to be if you need to wear a shirt made with this type of fabric longer than a few hours. When I wore these shirts under my short sleeve work shirt they became foul smelling on long hot days. I thought it might be me forgetting deodorant or something, I even carried a spare stick in my truck. After I switched to another brand with anti-odor/Anti-microbial properties I didnt have the odor issues I had with the Nike Dry Fit. So this consideration is rated by me a critical fail.

Additionally these are not advertised as having any sun protection capability, another component I need here in NW Florida. I now wear this type of shirt to play tennis to try to stay cool in the summer and get some protection from the sun to make my dermatologist happy. I want to avoid sunscreen so it doesnt mess up my grip on the racquet. After wearing these shirts for nearly a year my dermatologist treated and area in the middle of my back. Hence my renewed interest in UPF shirts. Again this area is rated by me as a critical fail.

Bottom Line: Just dont, I have to replace these Nike Dry Fit shirts to get the anti-odor/Anti-microbial and UPF 50 capabilities available in other shirts so I wasted my money on Nike. Im trying the Vapor Apparel Mens UPF Long Sleeve Solar Performance T-Shirt as a replacement.",,,,,,,
The Nike Mens Legend Poly Long Sleeve Dri-Fit T-shirt arrived within the scheduled time frame and was exactly as described on the site. It fits well, is very comfortable and I would recommend it to anyone that either works out or, wants to wear it as a long sleeved shirt under a short sleeved shirt.,,,,,
The sleeves are so long. Im 60. 165lbs. I wear an XL. The sleeves hang past my hands about 3-4 inches.,,,,,,,
"I bought this shirt from another site since it was a lot cheaper.

The shirt definitely runs large. Im 510"", 170 lbs, and usually wear mediums for Nike shirts, and they arent too loose on me. I bought a small of this shirt and it fits me very well, you could maybe even say its a little baggy, which is fine with me.

The shirt is thin, made to wear in the summer or for workouts, not the best to keep warm.

However, the shirt is very comfortable and its not too thin that you can see through it.",,,,,,,
This is a nice quality shirt, especially if you order the right size. I ordered it for my husband who is small in stature. He is 5ft. 7 and 150 pounds. I ordered a medium and it fits him very well. He loved the shirt so much that I ordered another one in Maroon. Unfortunately, they sent me the red which is why I only gave four stars as opposed to five. The only reason why I didnt send it back is because my husband decided to go ahead and keep the red even though that is not the color I wanted.,,,,,
Very nice fit and feel.Well made. Its a kind of a semi-mesh fabric that looks to be breathable. Would buy another one anytime soon. Im pleased with my purchase.,,,,,,,
"The picture of the product shows a Nike check.
Be aware the shirt may not have a Nike check.
As seen below, mine did not.",,,,,,,
"PRICED ABOVE MSRP. First thing first. These are Overpriced. This particular Nike Dri-Fit Training shirt has an MSRP of $22 (see picture of the tag from the green shirt for $22 and I paid $24 for it) and most of them listed here are going for $22-$30. That is ridiculous. You can go to Dicks Sporting Goods website and get them for $16.50. I ordered two of these shirts in red and green size XL for $23 and $24 respectively. The only reason I ordered these is because I thought they were the Dri-Fit Ts that normally retail for ~$35 and I thought I was getting a good deal. I have two of the $35 dri-fit t-shirts already, which fit really nice (not tight, I hate tight shirts, but not loose). These cheaper dri-fit t-shirts fit much larger than the $35 ones (see picture red $22 MSRP from amazon on left and navy $35 MSRP from Dicks on right, both XL). I am 63"", 230 lbs and the XL feels like I am wearing a dress.

I will be returning these shirts. I paid too much for what they actually are, and on top of that the fit is a little on the large size. There is no problem with the shirts quality wise, besides the larger fit. But if you do want one of these, do yourself a favor and dont order from here. Order it from Dicks for $16.50.",,,,,,,
"Fantastic product, the high quality stuff you expect from Nike.

Fits a tad large, but this is a performance shirt, so the idea behind it is to remove swear from the body and dry out. Dont expect this to hug at all, its meant to be a tad loose.

Awesome for warmer climates and situations where you gotta sweat but stay cool!",,,,,,,
Nice, comfortable shirt. I wear it playing tennis, jogging, boating, or just out running errands. It does seem to run a bit large, and long, but not so bad that I dont like it. I have several colors, and it is odd that they have such a wide range of prices. White was cheapest.
Im such a big fan of this running and workout shirt. It wicks moisture very well. I actually use it for hiking to keep my body cool, especially as a base layer during the spring or early fall.,,,,,,
The Nike Mens Legend shirt fit great for my son. He used it at summer camp as he was part of the purple cabin. He wore the shirt for all types of activities including game time, lunch/dinner, free time and various sporting events. The shirt did a great job wicking moisture away from his body and provided great protection from the elements. I would recommend this shirt as a great outdoor/indoor activity shirt.,,,,,
Nice fit and wears as advertised. Dri material retains slight smell after a few wears and washes. Does seem to go away after a deep soak and cleanse.,,,,,,,
Awesome and comfortable shirt! I wear when working out, playing tennis, and just around the house. Good price as well!,,,,,
This particular shirt came quite a bit larger than my other Medium Nike Dri-Fits. I noticed they were all made in different countries, so that might be the issue. Ill try and buy these shirts from local stores to make sure its the nice tight fit I was hoping for.,,,,,,
"Not yellow
It is a puke color and it was wadded up in the package
Don’t think it’s original nike",,,,,,,
Definitely great and authentic Nike quality, but a bit too large. Ordered a 2x, and its seriously huge.,,,,,
Quality is good but its extremely LARGE. Im 60 220pounds and the size large was dancing over my body,,,,,,,
Comfortable and fits well. I bought it late spring and have only worn it for a short run, but it breathed well. Would highly recommend it.,,,,,,
Purchased them for my daughter in law and she loves them. Very well made.,,,,,,,
fav longsleeve to work out it. i got the red/burgandy and always get compliments on the color,,,,,,,
Perfect Shirt, I love the high quality and it is very comfortable and light for the summer! I gave 4 stars because is a little large for me.,,,,,,
Great sports gear and my daughter loves them.,,,,,,,
It is an excellent product,,,,,,,
PERFECT ORANGE & FITS GREAT!,,,,,,,
Great looking casual shirt,,,,,,,
Very nice warm weather top for active sports.,,,,,,,
very thin fabric,,,,,,,
As noted, fit the person it was for great.,,,,,,
nice,,,,,,,
Just received the shirts and they fit as expected. Im very happy.,,,,,,,
XS is good fit but sleeves were too tight.,,,,,,,
I got this shirt today and I made the mistake to go by the size chart! Im 5ft 137lbs and according to the chart Im large but is way-way too big on me, Im returning this item.,,,,,,
I didnt realize this shirt was sheer. Super disappointed. I thought Id be able to wear it out for running errands & working out, but now I have to send it back.,,,,,,
Itchy... material not soft.,,,,,,,
Perfect for what I needed,,,,,,,
Cotton material, NOT dri-fit material. Not tight and I got an XS. Still a cute shirt but,,,,,,
Perfect,,,,,,,
I ordered a extra Large like all my others. This seems to run way small. Order up a size or two.,,,,,,,
I wear this every Monday Wednesday and Friday when I work on my upper body, it feels great! I love how it feels, I dont feel all nasty and wet and feel like my clothes is sticking to my body after Im done with my work out, not tight nice and loose, some people might not like it like that but I do, I recommend if you want it a little tight then get a size lower, I got the size I wear on my regular shirts and it was a little big but I like it like that.,
My husband loves these shirts!,,,,,,,
"The fit is good and I think for most people these would be perfect. I find I am always between sizes and this is no exception. My shoulders stick out a bit more than I would desire and the neck and arm holes are snug. I am 6 and weigh 175 43"" chest, 33"" waist so finding clothes is hard for me. Nonetheless these are high quality shirts that I will happily wear. They are a bit pricey for a sleeveless tee but they are Nike.",,,,,,,
"Fit was great, love the color, husband liked the ""muscle t"" look with the wider tank straps.",,,,,,,
super comfortable shirt,,,,,,,
Fits well and feels good,,,,,,,
Great shirt,,,,,,,
The shirt is fine but I got a medium and it is a little large. If you like your workout shirts a little looser than this is a good choice.,,,,,,,
I am very disappointed by the quality of this T shirt. It has a low quality material and does not compare to other Nike Dri-Fit clothing which we have bought in the past. After washing it once following the instructions it came out of the washer all fluffy with lots of lints on it (see the attached photo). I would not recommend buying it if you are looking for a good quality Dri-Fit T.,,,,,,,

This fits differently than my original Dri-Fit shirt, which I love. The shoulders are smaller, the material is different and a lighter weight (a little bit of see-through), and the torso is blousier. If you have broad or muscley shoulders, it will feel a bit tight. Overall weird fit for me.,,,
Seems to be cheaper material than Nikes other dry-fit shirts. A little long and loose around the waist, but I prefer that over being tight.,,,,,,
Will defiantly be replacing all my casual shirts with these in every color. Very nice material breaths well without being see through. Streatchy so very comfortable and perfect for outdoor activities and exercising drys quick exactly what it was supposed to do!,,,,,,,
I am a plus size after having a baby. I read the reviews of all those who said it ran large. I usually size up when buying online but due to those reviews I bought my usual size. This thing does not run big..,,,,,,,
The image is of a sports bra rather than of the black shirt I got for workouts.,,,,,,,
Fit really small but love the feel of the material wish it wouldve fit right,,,,,,,
"Great shirt for the gym. The M fit is somewhat loose, which I expected for the style.

Two stars because this shirt retails at $24.99 on the tag. Theyre selling at a premium.

My advice, wait until the price drops to at least $20 to get a better deal or run out to the nearest sporting goods store and buy one on sale at a retail store.",,,,,,,
I dont like to wear tight clothing when I run, but this was too big.,,,,,,
Excellent fit and the material dries fast. Great value and great design for workout or even casual wear.,,,,,,,
1.5 sizes too big but wearable. If wear a medium maybe opt for a small.,,,,,,,
Fit well and tighter than the Nike Womens Miler Short sleeve top,,,,,,,
Love this, its light weight and not clingy. I will be ordering again...,,,,,,
Comfy, however, little thick (warm) for summers,,,,,
This is more see through than the old dri-fit shirts. Its also on the large side. Im usually between a small and medium and I got the small but it was still a bit large after a few rounds in the dryer on high. Pretty color though and seems like its made well.,,,,,,,
"i dont know what happened but I bought 2 dry-fit T shirts size L (I have one M and it is a little tight thats why I bought L), but what I received wasnt what I expected. I had to give them to my husband and they fit them ok.
I am in argentina so I cant sned them back.
It was a waste of money.",,,,,,,
Niceeee nicceeee shirt,,,,,,,
Love Nike gear,,,,,,,
good quality,,,,,,,
Good shirt!,,,,,,,
Not even the same shirt that was shown! The purple is actually a dark pinkish color not a deep purple like what is in the images and description. It doesnt have the nike logo on the front and it has mesh on the back and sides. Not at all what was shown in the pictures.,,,,,,,
The color. Was not what the web site showed.,,,,,,,
Great Shirt,,,,,,,
Arrived quickly and great price!,,,,,,,
Ordered the Royal blue . Its much much brighter than the picture. Also ordered an XS and is still too big. Cannot wear it for this race.,,,,,,,
Nice color,,,,,,,
Nice color - if you are looking for a fitted look this is not the shirt - I wear a medium and its a little big - but the small would have been to small,,,,,,,
Wonderful shirt! Looks great and feels better. My daughter typically wears a womens small to med.so we hot small and its still loose,,,,,,,
Love this shirt!! I use it for my gym workouts, very comfortable and goes with everything.,,,,,,
Nice fit and very light,,,,,,,
It was larger than I expected. I should have ordered a small one for next time. But overall its comfortable for workout so Im happy with it.,,,,,,,
I received this shirt the day after I ordered it! And then ordered it in another color because of how perfect it is,,,,,,,
I love this material. When I work out and wear this shirt I dont feel like it weighs me down when I sweat,,,,,,,
Nothing like last years Legend Tee which fit better and I liked the material better.,,,,,,,
Great condition,,,,,,,
Fits great, nice material!,,,,,,
Its bit large but I like that for my jiu jitsu class.. Good buy and fast delivery,,,,,,,
very bad quality......the logo not white,its gray logo......its exist in local market by 3 usd,,,,,,
You can find a better product fot that price, too expensive and not that great,,,,,,
Very nice,,,,,,,
Excellent fit! Quality fabric. Love the color. Holds up to frequent washing and drying. Couldnt be happier.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt!,,,,,,,
Perfect cut. Not too tight but has a feminine, not boxy, cut. Love it.,,,,,
Color is not as shown, fit is loose.,,,,,,
Wish it was just a bit bigger in width. But it is just what I wanted for looks. Very comfortable. I have washed it and it did not shrink.,,,,,,,
Perfect, it was a gift, She loved it,,,,,
Color is it even close to what is pictured. Its is not a bright gold/yellow.. its a dull tan/pale gold color,,,,,,,
This shirt is the only shirt I use for exercising. I have five of them and love them. The fit is perfect.,,,,,,,
perfect fit,,,,,,,
It wasnt as nice as the one with the same name (DriFit) purchased in a store; its a very thin material.,,,,,,,
Clearly not a real small!,,,,,,,
Great fit, true to size,,,,,,
arrived in time for Christmas. Fit perfectly.,,,,,,,
Arrived on time and exactly as described.,,,,,,,
Thinner than some of my other Nike tops but a good length. I would buy again!,,,,,,,
Fits my wife perfectly. Looks great and keeps you cool on hot days!,,,,,,,
Grandaughter loves it !,,,,,,,
Great length and light weight. True to color,,,,,,,
The fit was as expected. Im very happy with this shirt. Its soft, thick enough to not see through and long enough so I can go through airport security and raise my arms without showing my stomach. I love it,,,,,,
Great t-shirt but runs small. Very fit cut,,,,,,,
good, but I had a mistake when I choose the size, it is too long, it covered my hip,,,,
This is not yellow. It is beige. I like the shirt but dont order unless you want beige.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt feels great,,,,,,,
Love it,,,,,,,
Runs a tiny bit large but fast shipping and exactly what I was looking for,,,,,,,
Runs long, but happy to have senior rear covered.,,,,,,
Fitted as expected! Keeps me cool during a workout,,,,,,,
What i wanted,,,,,,,
Love it,,,,,,,
"i hate this shirt. it is NOT like my other Nike crew neck dry fit shirt.
they obviously discountinued the one i like because i cant find it anywhere.
this is not a fitted shirt. i wear a small( in a fitted shirt) this one fits baggy and loose and long.",,,,,,,
Great material and comfort,,,,,,,
ok,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,
Love it!!,,,,,,,
Very cool garment; will enjoy wearing it!,,,,,,,
I LOVE IT!,,,,,,,
Love it! Easy handling when traveling.,,,,,,,
Excellent product , highly recommended.,,,,,,
This is a nice basic workout t-shirt. It keeps you dry, fit well and is comfortable.,,,,,,
Great fit.,,,,,,,
I didnt like the quality!,,,,,,,
Love this,,,,,,,
Fits comfortably,,,,,,,
Very confortable,,,,,,,
Great top for soccer.,,,,,,,
Ok a bit long...,,,,,,,
Super large neck line,,,,,,,
I bought this shirt thinking the size would run large as thats what many of the reviews said. I did not feel that way about this shirt. I did not like the way it fit me. I am pretty broad and chesty and this shirt was definitely unflattering. It is made for very slim and petite women, not for me. I returned it immediately.,,,,,,
Bought this for my older sister as a christimas present. She loves it so much and commonly gets compliments on it! I plan on getting her a few more next christmas.,,,,,,,
Good as expected.,,,,,,,
Great feeling, rapids drying shirts. Planning a motorcycle trip and taking along a few of these. Rinse out at night and let hand dry.,,,,,,
Great fit, super comfortable, warm, but doesnt make you sweat. Its a perfect workout shirt or great for wearing under a jersey.,,,,
"I enjoy this shirt, as it works for what I intended it for. It was a little bigger than expected, bigger than many other ""Large"" shirts I have but not overly large. Its just a bit loose and a little thin, thats all. Works great though, as I use it as an undershirt in layering for the upper Midwest winters, as it can be quite cold up here. Comfortable, but it should be a bit cheaper, like $20 would be more acceptable. My main gripe is that Nike is really pushing it selling it for about $30 (for just a plain white t-shirt!) just because they can.",,,,,,,
This shirt is very nice, I bought the green one for my husband. The material is thinner but it falls and fits very nice, it does not cling. I highly recommend this shirt.,,,,,
These teet-shirts fit the way I wanted them to, for the size I thought. I have no problem ordering the way I had , thank you.,,,,,
Nice lightweight shirt. Great for working out, or wearing in the sun when you need extra coverage, but want to stay cool.,,,,,
some what too large but good quality sleeves a little too long also good quality so i gave it 3 stars no i would not buy again,,,,,,,
Great training shirt. Dont expect these to keep you warm as they are pretty thin, however they are very nice and soft and looks great. Its a somewhat fitted shirt, so make sure you dont have a tummy or it will show lol.,,,,,
My husband loves this Tee. He washes it in woolite and hang to dry. Last a long time!,,,,,,,
Comfortable, but like any other white workout shirt, will stain with sunscreen.,,,,,
My significant other was very happy with the material of this shirt and it fit perfect,,,,,,,
The sizes run smaller than most, had to return it. Sorry to say they didnt have same in larger sizes.,,,,,,
Excellent quality and price. Fit perfectly. My husband love it.,,,,,,,
Cheap quality with thin material. Not happy with what I got for the price.,,,,,,,
Warm yet cool, looks fresh and feels great. No issues, fits well.,,,,,
Needed a purple shirt. This was a great choice.,,,,,,,
Great Fit! Perfect Wash and Wear!!,,,,,,,
Son loves it. He looks good in it,,,,,,,
Great product, great seller!!!,,,,,,
Im slightly disappointed because the image I viewed appeared that the product faded from a washed out purple to a saturated purple below the shoulders. I referenced the same image while writing this review and have determined that flood lighting is creating a washed out effect on the promotional image. I used the item as a wind breaker over a sweat shirt for a team event that required a purple shirt. I will normally use it as a winter running shirt.,,,,,,,
too big not matter what size,,,,,,,
love the design and fit,,,,,,,
A little bit longer on sleeves than hope for but all in all great!,,,,,,,
nice shirt, comfy and well made,,,,,,
Looks great and fits well,,,,,,,
a gift and was loved,,,,,,,
Another satisfied customer,,,,,,,
Fits great. Extra coverage to keep the sun off during the long runs. Easy clean. Love it!,,,,,,,
Got it for our son-in-law for Christmas - he loved it and has worn it several times!,,,,,,,
Great color and size is a good fit. Happy with purchase.,,,,,,,
Fantastic product. Im absolutely in love with Nike Dri-Fit products,,,,,,,
I got this shirt as a gift for my boyfriend and he really likes it. It fits as expected and he likes that its light on him while he runs. Very timely shipping!,,,,,,,
I purchased one of these in hope of finding something that is light enough to wear and use at the gym, but still thick enough to where my nips wouldnt be popping out the whole time. Im pleased with the buy. The quality is great. Im 511 and weigh about 165-70. I went with a large and am happy i did so. Wear a tank top underneath though. If your gym is cold your nips mighy show.,,,,,,
Very good quality. Great value.,,,,,,,
Fits nice and feels good.,,,,,,,
Comfy,,,,,,,
Excellent product, price and shipping,,,,,,
Fits perfect,,,,,,,
Nice shirt. I have one in gray and now this one in white. I like the fit, i.e., not baggy, and the thinness of the fabric. Other brands are thicker, and I find that makes me too hot while exercising. Also great to wear in the sun.,,,
Bought this for my son and he loves it! Fits as expected!,,,,,,,
This is made in Mexico. The Vietnam fabric is much better.,,,,,,,
I liked this Nike long sleeve a lot.,,,,,,,
Too large,,,,,,,
Great,,,,,,,
I got the large. It looks great, however really is....welll.... quite large. I am 6 feet tall, around 200 pounds with a relatively athletic physique and this is still quite a bit too big on me. Feels more like an extra large. Insanely comfortable though and it still looks great. I would just size down if at all possible.,,,,,
I bought this shirt for longer runs (10+ miles) here in Central Florida on days when it is typically over 90 degrees and over 90% humidity. It definitely makes a difference with the white color as it is highly reflective and keeps you cooler in that regard. Secondly, you are now evaporating sweat from both your skin and the shirt, creating a better core temp cooling mechanism. I recommend.,,,,,
Super super comfortable an awesome looking but the only problem is when you order a large it comes in a slightly smaller size so its not Amazons fault, but rather Nikes for making a shirt and not giving it the proper size but overall still a great purchase and a goal to work towards,,,,,,
The long sleeves feels good but the size are a little bigger then what I ordered. I wear a medium but when I put this on, it feels and look a little bigger then medium but a little smaller then a large.,,,,,,
"Great breathable and ultra-light running shirt! The fit for the M is spot on for someone bw around 510 - 62"", with decent chest room (ie not too snug)",,,,,,,
"Comfortable dry-fit long sleeve t-shirt.
Fits well on medium frame-size.
Made in Jordan.",,,,,,,
great for the gym!,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,
Ive bought several of these. Their great to work out in or to lounge around in.,,,,,,,
bought this for a co-worker for secret santa. bought him a medium but it fits like a large. He still uses it though :) shipped and delivered on time,,,,,,,
"This was ordered for my very thin grandson. He usually wears a mens small, but this was still a bit loose in the small, but he still likes it.
",,,,,,,
100f outside and this long sleeve is keeping me cool, love thus shirt buying more,,,,,,
Fits well like to wear to the gym with my Nike Mens Free Trainer 3.0 V3 Training Shoe [Color: Game Royal/White] its a perfect match. When you running keeps the sweat under control. This way when you leave the gym you arent exposed to the cold air. I have few brands of shirts, but actually find these the most comfortable.,,,,,,
Just as you would expect. But smaller than most. Would get the next size up,,,,,,,
"Nice fit
not see through own two",,,,,,,
shirt feels very good on skin. keeps you cool and fits as expected,,,,,,,
I would recommend. Love the fit and color. No surprises here.,,,,,,,
Very good shirt made with nice expensive looking material. The shirt fits very well. I purchased the purple because most of the other colors were sold out in large. I was skeptical of the color because its purple. However, the shirt looks really good on.,,,,,,
Bought it for a Christmas gift & they loved it,,,,,,,
great shirt - fits accordingly and looks great - highly recommend,,,,,,,
"I ordered size M, its a little tight around chest, sending it back.

The material is dri-fit, very thin, but durable, not too bad for $32 I paid.",,,,,,,
A little oversized, decent quality.,,,,,,
I love this ! I would buy more!,,,,,,,
Nice color and fit,,,,,,,
Came in as red and not maroon my boyfriend ended up keeping it but now he has two of the same color,,,,,,,
Dont typically buy clothing from Amazon, but my husband has a NIKE Black long sleeve crew and wanted a white one. The size is accurate.,,,,,,
The outside tag said Large but when tried on realized it was very tight. The inside tag showed it was a small.,,,,,,,
exelent,,,,,,,
some of these run so small like they are meant for undershirts or workout only but this is a good shirt for relaxing or casual wear no form fitting,,,,,,,
I bought this lightweight dry fit for my husband to wear to the gym. He loves it. It provides extra warmth under his t shirt because our gym is always freezing cold. I bought a medium, he weighs about 165 and is 5 10 and it fits true to size.,,,,,,
great!!!,,,,,,,
Got for my father-in-law for Christmas, who usually wears a Tall, and it fit very well. He loved it so much he wore it two days in a row! LOL!,,,,,
Nice Shirt.,,,,,,,
Great fit and quality, exactly what I needed,,,,,,
Fits well throughout chest and back etc. Was expecting more of a tight fit through the arms however and wrists, however. All in all a great shirt though.,,,,,,
Great purchase. Im 62 200 pounds and ordered a large. The shirt fits great and came MUCH faster than the ETA,,,,,,,
The upper part of the sleeves are oddly baggy, while the lower forearm fits as expected. My husband isnt really a fan of it, but I think I will try to alter it so the upper arms fit more like they should.,,,,,
Great shirt for the price....Very comfortable!,,,,,,,
I was very disappointed. It was thinner and more see-through than the picture depicted. I will just use it as an undershirt on a cold day.,,,,,,,
Arrived on time and looks okay - not really impressed with the material and it had a weird smell to it when it first arrived.,,,,,,,
you can buy it at the same price outside.,,,,,,,
I bought two of these and love them. Loose fitting and lightweight. Perfect for working, hiking/camping, or just lounging around the house.,,,,,
Fits beautifully,,,,,,,
Love this shirt. Excellent for working out in or just casual wear.,,,,,,,
I have three of these all different colors. Ordered them from the same place. Fast shipping! Will buy a few more in different colors soon.,,,,,,,
"A gift for my hubby, He is 511"" 173lbs, I got him size L. It fits well.",,,,,,,
Bought it for my husband, looks And fits great,,,,,,
It was perfect just what my grandson wanted. The fit was just right, the purple was a beautiful color. Very pleased.,,,,,,
Perfect fit, great for running.,,,,,,
For some reason this fabric snags very easily on velcro. (the hook side). I have a dozen of these NikeFit that I bought years ago that dont do that.,,,,,,,
Bit larger than description.,,,,,,,
These are sized a little bigger than you would think or are used too. But the quality is still the NIKE quality. I would easy buy again.,,,,,,,
An excellent & interesting transaction,,,,,,,
Dri-Fit T-shirts are a great idea. I wear it when I play tennis in the sun to keep the sun off of my arms. It is great!,,,,,,,
I really love this as a long sleeve under shirt, under my golf polo shirts. Or can be worn as an outer shirt, its not very heavy, very light breathable material,,,,
"Great fit , exactly as described, fast delivery
I would order from this seller again",,,,,,,
My husband loves these shirts for running in the winter. Bought as a Christmas present.,,,,,,,
"I bought this t-shirt for my daughters boy friend he loved it.
Beautiful blue",,,,,,,
My husband really likes these shirts and this one is one of his favorites. Its thin enough to wear underneath a sweatshirt/fleece or to layer over a tshirt. Dri-fit material.,,,,,,,
It is great and my nephew loved it, the material was comfortable and the fit was good,,,,,,
Bought as a gift for my brother - he loves it! Stated is was comfortable and washed great. He is tall and has broad shoulders - fit great all the way around.,,,,,,,
Perfect shirt if you are running outdoors in the winter or late fall. It fits loose and is very comfortable! I would definitely reccommend this product.,,,,,,,
Great shirt, cool, nice material. Fits a littler big but is great for exercising when it is not that hot out.,,,,,
I rock one of these in a different color at least 5 days a week. Theyre legit af,,,,,,,
Arms are a bit tight where they attach to the body. Otherwise fits as expected.,,,,,,,
All perfect, thanks!!!!,,,,,,
Was not what i expected, please be careful of what the item description says and what your expectations are.,,,,,,
??,,,,,,,
Slow ship but worth the wait.,,,,,,,
I am somewhat dissapointed with how dark the color of the shirt is .,,,,,,,
Great long sleeve running shirt. Ive owned these before so no big surprise.,,,,,,,
Nike is still the best dry fit weave available, Ive bought adidas and others but they can be scratchy.,,,,,,
This shirt will get you hella chicks,,,,,,,
Too thin !Long sleeves!,,,,,,,
Fits perfectly and material is light for late spring/early fall weather in the mid-west.,,,,,,,
You get what you pay for. Very thin, badly fitting shirt,,,,,,
Fits good, but this is way light weight. In fact you can see right thought this shirt? For the price I thought it would be higher quality Nike.,,,,,,
Nice quality and good finishing as well. If you have an athletic body type this would look perfect. I use these for gym and dont feel sweaty.,,,,,,,
Bought a medium; small would probably be the right fit,,,,,,,
Fits just as expected. Im very happy with my purchase,,,,,,,
Great color,though i wish the swoosh was embroidered..,,,,,,
Ive bought several of these & they are a good look & so comfortable!,,,,,,,
"It isnt made of the same material as the ""Nike Dri-fit"". The item is also too small.
Not happy with this purchase.",,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
I was skeptical, but believe all the other reviewers now- this runs really a size or size and a half big. I usually wear a L, but this was the biggest, longest M Ive ever seen!,,,,
Fits perfectly. Feels great in the heat considering I walk all day as a letter carrier.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt, fits very good. Like the fabric. Will be good sun protection without being too hot.,,,,,,
I like the color, the fit, the weight (perfect for coolish summer days).,,,,,
Loved it!,,,,,,,
Awesome shirt and fits as expected..,,,,,,,
Loose sleeves exactly what I wanted for bug protection.,,,,,,,
Fits slightly bigger than expected, but great product. Exactly what I was looking for!,,,,,,
Light and dry feel.,,,,,,,
My husband likes this shirt a lot,,,,,,,
The material is strange. Tends to hold body odor and doesnt breathe well. Not liking it so far,,,,,,,
Grandson was very proud of it.,,,,,,,
great fit, just what i wanted,,,,,,
very nice fit true to sizing,,,,,,,
Shirt fits loosely, but is true to size.,,,,,,
Shirt was the perfect gift.,,,,,,,
Good shirt but doesnt fit as expected.,,,,,,,
like it wont buy again was charge shipping should have been free my order said 1 of 2 on this order ps who can i contact on this ?,,,,,,,
Bought this as a gift for a friend at the gym. He loved it and it fits him great.,,,,,,,
very comfortable shirt.,,,,,,,
Great shirt. Love it!,,,,,,,
Its a nice shirt, but it was for my 13 year old son and it almost fits my husband who wears a large.,,,,,,
it is not cotton , it looks like the football Tshirt in its material ,,,,,,
Good quality material,,,,,,,

Fits great, looks great and the material is high quality.,,,,,,
Returned. Too big. My fault for trusting the 4 yr. old size of Nike Dri-Fit apparel.,,,,,,,
"Never bought anything from Nike I didnt like.. Versatile true to size cool color shirt
Well made",,,,,,,
A little big in the arms. My boyfriend loves it and its great quality,,,,,,,
A little tight but perfect for an under layer.,,,,,,,
Husband is very happy with this tee & I was happy with the price!,,,,,,,
Awsome,,,,,,,

Got a little big, but not extremely oversized, I like a lose fiting clothing.,,,,,
Perfect fit but I recommend medium or small size large looks like its a X-large long sleeve shirt,,,,,,,

Returned for one size smaller, arms way too long,,,,,,
Great shirt.,,,,,,,

I purchased for travel. Stores well in the suit case and is comfortable for travel or by the pool. You cant go wrong.,,,,,,,
LOOKS GREAT!,,,,,,,
I would recommend getting a size smaller than ure size,,,,,,,
Very good Dri-Fit long sleeve shirt for running in cool weather.,,,,,,,
Absolutely Perfect!!,,,,,,,
Good quality...good fit.....nice material for a trip as it is easy to clean,,,,,,,
great shirt, very comfortable and form fitting,,,,,,
These shirts are great for working out. Keeps you dry and very comfortable. I have used them for hiking in cold weather as well as an undershirt to wick sweat away.,,,,,,,
Item as described,,,,,,,
Awesome like all things Nike. The only thing is the neck line runs a little loose for my liking. A thicker seam on the neckline would make this shirt perfect.,,,,,,,
Shirt fit as expected and was the exact shade of red I wanted.,,,,,,,
Fits well, easy to wrestle in and work out in,,,,,,
fits great,,,,,,,
Great,,,,,,,
Good shirt!,,,,,,,

Just right,,,,,,,
The shirt fits perfect and the price is alot cheaper than in a store!!,,,,,,,

thx,,,,,,,
Great fit; light weight .Perfect to work out in which was just what he wanted.,,,,,,,
This shirt is great for warming up, light workouts, or running outside/on the treadmill. It fits really well, and is thin so it is very breathable.,,,,
Extraordinarily thin material. Maybe thats the way it is supposed to be.,,,,,,,
Very good,,,,,,,
thank you,,,,,,,
I love this,,,,,,,
GOOD!GOOD!GOOD!,,,,,,,

Good fits,,,,,,,
Love it!,,,,,,,
Excelent,,,,,,,
#swag,,,,,,,
good for price,,,,,,,
It fit well.,,,,,,,
Fast shipping. Exactly what i wanted,,,,,,,
Shirt fits very well, is very soft and comfortable. I ordered a few more in other colors. Good for exercising.,,,,,,
as expected,,,,,,,
fits great,,,,,,,
Ordered a size small...it was huge...and I am 5.10 and 150 LBs...,,,,,,,
Love these Nike Dri-Fit crew tops. Long sleeve or short sleeve they make for great casual shirts or workout shirts. Theyre breathable, durable, and fashionable. The heather grey color is my favorite. I bought this one to replace the one I let my friend borrow(which he has yet to return). Great product!,,,,,
My son wanted to purchase this. While I felt it was a bit overpriced, he was very happy with it. The material is very breathable.,,,,,,
Bought it for my husband. He loves these dry-fit tees and wanted this color. He was somewhat disappointed because it fit him larger than the other long sleeve dry-fit Nike tees that he has bought in the past. For future buyers, I recommend buying a size smaller.,,,,,,
Fit perfect - large as expected. Great material that dries quick.,,,,,,,
is bad,,,,,,,
I use this for golf when I go to practice and occasionally play. Feels great in Texas summers at 100+ degree heat. Usually a concern for me is how see threw the white is but I have not had that problem with this product! Am going to buy more and get a polo version as well,,,,,,,
This is a nice product, but the arms are very long compared with the body. If you need a shirt for a bigger body, but dont have particularly long arms, you may want to look at other similar products.,,,,
It doesnt feel like a Nike product. Looks like a cheap rip off.,,,,,,,
Solid shirt. I got this item for the gym but I also wear it when Im not in the gym. It is light so it is very breathable. I have a few short sleeve versions of this shirt but I think Ill be getting more of these in the future.,,,,,,,
"Really like the shirt but it definitely runs large. I am 62"" and the sleeves are long and the neck opening is larger than I would like. Really wish I had ordered a size smaller but stuck with an expensive t-shirt.",,,,,,,
Fit perfectly,,,,,,,
Very nice fit, color very true to picture and size was very accurate, my husband loved it,,,,,
The only problem I have is that I paid 30 dollars for a 28 dollar shirt. Thats what it said on the tag !! I should have looked further for a better deal !!,,,,,,,
I would advise anyone purchasing to order a size down. I ordered a medium and it looks like a large plus its a very loose material so that makes it even bigger fitting.,,,,,,,
My husband really likes this shirt however it swallows him. And the sleeves are long. Still giving 4 stars because for someone that it fits it would be perfect.,,,,,,,
This is a nice shirt for working out or casual wear. It is really thin material so can be worn in summer too. It fits nice, not super tight but like a t-shirt.,,,,,,
The shirt arrived quickly, and his extremely comfortable. I recommend this product for anyone that is interested in being comfortable while working out.,,,,,,
Everything arrived on time and in good condition. Great product for working out - exactly what I was hoping for / expected. Happy with my purchase,,,,,,,
He said its light weight very comfortable. As for me the wash, Can wear right out of dryer and its looks brand new. I bought all colors for him.,,,,,,
"The material is cheap. Not what I expected from reading the reviews. Ive bought actual Nike ""dri-fit"" from Nike and those were actually very durable and warm. This material is very thin. If you want it just for looks for the gym, I guess its ok but for its purpose -dont buy",,,,,,,
It doesnt seem authentic. It was huge. Small fit like a large. Material isnt similar to Nikes shirts.,,,,,,,
To large for me,,,,,,,
I ordered an XL and I received an XL Tall. Does not fit well at all. Product is not as described.,,,,,,,
Great it is exactly what I ordered.....great product and great price, would order more of these in the future for sure,,,,,,
The shirt was a little too big but I still use it. It works great and worth the price I paid.,,,,,,,
Excellent quality. My grandson loved it and it looked great on him. Very pleased.,,,,,,,
S Size was a bit large and wide for me in the sleeves, but still being a good product!,,,,,,
this product is very good, apart from their arrival shipping services consider them the best,,,,,,
Good fit and so far good quality to resistance to wear and tear,,,,,,,
No comment,,,,,,,
Nice Long Sleeve!,,,,,,,
great product snd customer service,,,,,,,
Its ok,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
Dont buy it. When i saw this first time in my eyes, i couldnt believe my eyes. I ordered T-shirt not dress. So I measured this stupid long bodied T-shirt, it was 29.5 inches. How can man have a body lengths of 29.5 inches? Besides the fact that i am Asian, this T-shirt is way too long.,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
I was expecting more of an under armor type of shirt. you know, tightly fit on the sleeves to show off biceps.? A bit loose on the arms and short in length of the entire shirt. fits kind of awkward for my taste. Good material though.,,,,,,
I hate the fit as that the large fits like a normal x-large. Something was wrong with the sizing.,,,,,,,
About 100% sure this shirt isnt a real Nike Dri-Fit. I own about 4 different Dri-fits and this one is counterfeit. The Nike swoosh looks and feels fake, the fabric doesnt feel like a Dri fit.,,,,,,
Excelente. Continuaré comprando a este vendedor. Tienda recomendada para hacer más compras internacionales. GRACIAS POR LA VENTA DEL PRODUCTO. SALUDOS,,,,,,,
Comfy sweater especially for work in the spring and fall,,,,,,,
I initially ordered a couple of these Nike long sleeve shirts in a couple of colors to check out the quality of the material and the workmanship. Some people had posted that the shirts were too sheer and too light for their use. All I can say is that these shirts are my new faves for working out and for wearing under quarter zip pullover shirts. I think I have ordered a total of six or seven of these shirts in various colors and I was actually contemplating ordering a few more when amazon sent an email message asking me to post a review on these shirts. The shirts are generously sized. The material is high quality and is very comfortable next to my skin, unlike some of my other long sleeve work out shirts. The workmanship is excellent. They come in a wide variety of colors. And, they are only +/- $25.00 each. Believe me, you will not be disappointed. These shirts are a great value. Enjoy... and just do it !!,,,,
This dri fit shirt is made of very very thin/fine fabric. It completely takes to the shape of your body. So unless youve got a banging body this might not be the shirt for you. The other dri fit materials are made of a hardier fabric that can kind of keep their shape. I didnt like this one because of the fit. But if youre a runner looking for a next to naked feeling dri fit shirt, this might be the shirt for you.,,,,,,
Nice shirt. I normally wear an x-lg t-shirt, so I got this in an x-lg as well, but I wish I had opted for a large. This kind of shirt wasnt meant to be this loose. My fault, though, so Im still giving it 5-stars. I guess Ill get another, but in large, and Ill just wear this one while doing yard-work or something. Id recommend you guys to consider getting a size smaller than usual.,
"Found my new favorite shirt(s) can wear it for a run or out to eat and very comfortable. Fits good 5""10 165 lbs size large (maybe a tad loose but not bad) very thin though. Nike makes a version 2.0 to this shirt that has some cotton rather than 100% poly that I like better but still love this shirt.",,,,,,,
"really low quality material for this shirt I was expecting something way better for the price and the Nike brand although Im doubting if its actually legit. The Nike logo isnt reflective neither the ""Dri-Fit"" something I found weird because if you look closely to the other shirts they say NikeFit. My chest is quite visble with this tshirt something that Im not a fan though and I used and sweated it and it doesnt dry as my other Nike or whatever other sport brand tshirt. Sadly Im not in the US otherwise Id ask for a refund.

This review isnt biased. Nobody is paying to talk about the crappy product I bought is just a customers opinion about a con over a ""Nike"" shirt. Sad

Here are some pictures of the product.",,,,,,,
"I bought this shirt b/c I wanted a long sleeve shirt to wear around the house that wasnt too warm. This works perfectly. Its light, cool, and extremely comfortable.

Regarding the size, Im 60 and weight 230. I tend to buy XXL size shirts, but on the suggestion of other reviews, I ordered an XL. The fit is perfect, which is to say that any purchasers should also consider ordering a size smaller than normal.",,,,,,,
"The fabric is thin but nice, its overall a good looking shirt, but I have to return it since it was far too large. I normally order medium (I am 5 10.5), but I ordered small (which is the smallest size available) based on the reviews. Both the shirt and the sleeves are about 1 longer than the maximum that I would tolerate. There is also a lot of extra fabric under the armpits and the shirt fits pretty loosely, so I would just order 1-2 sizes smaller if that was possible. The shirt label says ""S"", so I was sent the correct size.",,,,,,,
Very cheap shirt, not like the photo what so ever. Im not sure why so much good reviews but its the only reason I thought i was getting a nice shirt which is cheap looking shirt, the only reason for the two starts is the super fast shipping!! Not worth the money! Believe me....,,,,,
"Great shirt. Love the material and feel. I usually get a large, but purchased med because of reviews. Fits good but I like shirts to be a little more loose. Going to order a couple more but large this time. Im 510, 180.

11-16-15 I ordered 2 more. I am LE and wear under my uniform. Hold up well and very comfortable.",,,,,,,
"I bought these shirts in 2014 and my initial response to these shirts was they were fantastic. All the seams l lie flat inside and out. Fit was good felt great on so long as I only wore them short term. So for fit and quality of manufacture they would get 5 stars, but this is 2016 and I believe there are some other considerations and technologies that should be added to this type of shirt. I used these shirts as I worked maintenance for a condo and later as a pest control technician.

Having anti-odor/Anti-microbial technology made into the shirt didnt seem that important when I bought these items. However, it has to be if you need to wear a shirt made with this type of fabric longer than a few hours. When I wore these shirts under my short sleeve work shirt they became foul smelling on long hot days. I thought it might be me forgetting deodorant or something, I even carried a spare stick in my truck. After I switched to another brand with anti-odor/Anti-microbial properties I didnt have the odor issues I had with the Nike Dry Fit. So this consideration is rated by me a critical fail.

Additionally these are not advertised as having any sun protection capability, another component I need here in NW Florida. I now wear this type of shirt to play tennis to try to stay cool in the summer and get some protection from the sun to make my dermatologist happy. I want to avoid sunscreen so it doesnt mess up my grip on the racquet. After wearing these shirts for nearly a year my dermatologist treated and area in the middle of my back. Hence my renewed interest in UPF shirts. Again this area is rated by me as a critical fail.

Bottom Line: Just dont, I have to replace these Nike Dry Fit shirts to get the anti-odor/Anti-microbial and UPF 50 capabilities available in other shirts so I wasted my money on Nike. Im trying the Vapor Apparel Mens UPF Long Sleeve Solar Performance T-Shirt as a replacement.",,,,,,,
The Nike Mens Legend Poly Long Sleeve Dri-Fit T-shirt arrived within the scheduled time frame and was exactly as described on the site. It fits well, is very comfortable and I would recommend it to anyone that either works out or, wants to wear it as a long sleeved shirt under a short sleeved shirt.,,,,,
The sleeves are so long. Im 60. 165lbs. I wear an XL. The sleeves hang past my hands about 3-4 inches.,,,,,,,
"I bought this shirt from another site since it was a lot cheaper.

The shirt definitely runs large. Im 510"", 170 lbs, and usually wear mediums for Nike shirts, and they arent too loose on me. I bought a small of this shirt and it fits me very well, you could maybe even say its a little baggy, which is fine with me.

The shirt is thin, made to wear in the summer or for workouts, not the best to keep warm.

However, the shirt is very comfortable and its not too thin that you can see through it.",,,,,,,
This is a nice quality shirt, especially if you order the right size. I ordered it for my husband who is small in stature. He is 5ft. 7 and 150 pounds. I ordered a medium and it fits him very well. He loved the shirt so much that I ordered another one in Maroon. Unfortunately, they sent me the red which is why I only gave four stars as opposed to five. The only reason why I didnt send it back is because my husband decided to go ahead and keep the red even though that is not the color I wanted.,,,,,
Very nice fit and feel.Well made. Its a kind of a semi-mesh fabric that looks to be breathable. Would buy another one anytime soon. Im pleased with my purchase.,,,,,,,
"The picture of the product shows a Nike check.
Be aware the shirt may not have a Nike check.
As seen below, mine did not.",,,,,,,
"PRICED ABOVE MSRP. First thing first. These are Overpriced. This particular Nike Dri-Fit Training shirt has an MSRP of $22 (see picture of the tag from the green shirt for $22 and I paid $24 for it) and most of them listed here are going for $22-$30. That is ridiculous. You can go to Dicks Sporting Goods website and get them for $16.50. I ordered two of these shirts in red and green size XL for $23 and $24 respectively. The only reason I ordered these is because I thought they were the Dri-Fit Ts that normally retail for ~$35 and I thought I was getting a good deal. I have two of the $35 dri-fit t-shirts already, which fit really nice (not tight, I hate tight shirts, but not loose). These cheaper dri-fit t-shirts fit much larger than the $35 ones (see picture red $22 MSRP from amazon on left and navy $35 MSRP from Dicks on right, both XL). I am 63"", 230 lbs and the XL feels like I am wearing a dress.

I will be returning these shirts. I paid too much for what they actually are, and on top of that the fit is a little on the large size. There is no problem with the shirts quality wise, besides the larger fit. But if you do want one of these, do yourself a favor and dont order from here. Order it from Dicks for $16.50.",,,,,,,
"Fantastic product, the high quality stuff you expect from Nike.

Fits a tad large, but this is a performance shirt, so the idea behind it is to remove swear from the body and dry out. Dont expect this to hug at all, its meant to be a tad loose.

Awesome for warmer climates and situations where you gotta sweat but stay cool!",,,,,,,
Nice, comfortable shirt. I wear it playing tennis, jogging, boating, or just out running errands. It does seem to run a bit large, and long, but not so bad that I dont like it. I have several colors, and it is odd that they have such a wide range of prices. White was cheapest.
Im such a big fan of this running and workout shirt. It wicks moisture very well. I actually use it for hiking to keep my body cool, especially as a base layer during the spring or early fall.,,,,,,
The Nike Mens Legend shirt fit great for my son. He used it at summer camp as he was part of the purple cabin. He wore the shirt for all types of activities including game time, lunch/dinner, free time and various sporting events. The shirt did a great job wicking moisture away from his body and provided great protection from the elements. I would recommend this shirt as a great outdoor/indoor activity shirt.,,,,,
Nice fit and wears as advertised. Dri material retains slight smell after a few wears and washes. Does seem to go away after a deep soak and cleanse.,,,,,,,
Awesome and comfortable shirt! I wear when working out, playing tennis, and just around the house. Good price as well!,,,,,
This particular shirt came quite a bit larger than my other Medium Nike Dri-Fits. I noticed they were all made in different countries, so that might be the issue. Ill try and buy these shirts from local stores to make sure its the nice tight fit I was hoping for.,,,,,,
"Not yellow
It is a puke color and it was wadded up in the package
Don’t think it’s original nike",,,,,,,
Definitely great and authentic Nike quality, but a bit too large. Ordered a 2x, and its seriously huge.,,,,,
Quality is good but its extremely LARGE. Im 60 220pounds and the size large was dancing over my body,,,,,,,
Comfortable and fits well. I bought it late spring and have only worn it for a short run, but it breathed well. Would highly recommend it.,,,,,,
Purchased them for my daughter in law and she loves them. Very well made.,,,,,,,
fav longsleeve to work out it. i got the red/burgandy and always get compliments on the color,,,,,,,
Perfect Shirt, I love the high quality and it is very comfortable and light for the summer! I gave 4 stars because is a little large for me.,,,,,,
Great sports gear and my daughter loves them.,,,,,,,
It is an excellent product,,,,,,,
PERFECT ORANGE & FITS GREAT!,,,,,,,
Great looking casual shirt,,,,,,,
Very nice warm weather top for active sports.,,,,,,,
very thin fabric,,,,,,,
As noted, fit the person it was for great.,,,,,,
nice,,,,,,,
Just received the shirts and they fit as expected. Im very happy.,,,,,,,
XS is good fit but sleeves were too tight.,,,,,,,
I got this shirt today and I made the mistake to go by the size chart! Im 5ft 137lbs and according to the chart Im large but is way-way too big on me, Im returning this item.,,,,,,
I didnt realize this shirt was sheer. Super disappointed. I thought Id be able to wear it out for running errands & working out, but now I have to send it back.,,,,,,
Itchy... material not soft.,,,,,,,
Perfect for what I needed,,,,,,,
Cotton material, NOT dri-fit material. Not tight and I got an XS. Still a cute shirt but,,,,,,
Perfect,,,,,,,
I ordered a extra Large like all my others. This seems to run way small. Order up a size or two.,,,,,,,
I wear this every Monday Wednesday and Friday when I work on my upper body, it feels great! I love how it feels, I dont feel all nasty and wet and feel like my clothes is sticking to my body after Im done with my work out, not tight nice and loose, some people might not like it like that but I do, I recommend if you want it a little tight then get a size lower, I got the size I wear on my regular shirts and it was a little big but I like it like that.,
My husband loves these shirts!,,,,,,,
"The fit is good and I think for most people these would be perfect. I find I am always between sizes and this is no exception. My shoulders stick out a bit more than I would desire and the neck and arm holes are snug. I am 6 and weigh 175 43"" chest, 33"" waist so finding clothes is hard for me. Nonetheless these are high quality shirts that I will happily wear. They are a bit pricey for a sleeveless tee but they are Nike.",,,,,,,
"Fit was great, love the color, husband liked the ""muscle t"" look with the wider tank straps.",,,,,,,
super comfortable shirt,,,,,,,
Fits well and feels good,,,,,,,
Great shirt,,,,,,,
The shirt is fine but I got a medium and it is a little large. If you like your workout shirts a little looser than this is a good choice.,,,,,,,
I am very disappointed by the quality of this T shirt. It has a low quality material and does not compare to other Nike Dri-Fit clothing which we have bought in the past. After washing it once following the instructions it came out of the washer all fluffy with lots of lints on it (see the attached photo). I would not recommend buying it if you are looking for a good quality Dri-Fit T.,,,,,,,

This fits differently than my original Dri-Fit shirt, which I love. The shoulders are smaller, the material is different and a lighter weight (a little bit of see-through), and the torso is blousier. If you have broad or muscley shoulders, it will feel a bit tight. Overall weird fit for me.,,,
Seems to be cheaper material than Nikes other dry-fit shirts. A little long and loose around the waist, but I prefer that over being tight.,,,,,,
Will defiantly be replacing all my casual shirts with these in every color. Very nice material breaths well without being see through. Streatchy so very comfortable and perfect for outdoor activities and exercising drys quick exactly what it was supposed to do!,,,,,,,
I am a plus size after having a baby. I read the reviews of all those who said it ran large. I usually size up when buying online but due to those reviews I bought my usual size. This thing does not run big..,,,,,,,
The image is of a sports bra rather than of the black shirt I got for workouts.,,,,,,,
Fit really small but love the feel of the material wish it wouldve fit right,,,,,,,
"Great shirt for the gym. The M fit is somewhat loose, which I expected for the style.

Two stars because this shirt retails at $24.99 on the tag. Theyre selling at a premium.

My advice, wait until the price drops to at least $20 to get a better deal or run out to the nearest sporting goods store and buy one on sale at a retail store.",,,,,,,
I dont like to wear tight clothing when I run, but this was too big.,,,,,,
Excellent fit and the material dries fast. Great value and great design for workout or even casual wear.,,,,,,,
1.5 sizes too big but wearable. If wear a medium maybe opt for a small.,,,,,,,
Fit well and tighter than the Nike Womens Miler Short sleeve top,,,,,,,
Love this, its light weight and not clingy. I will be ordering again...,,,,,,
Comfy, however, little thick (warm) for summers,,,,,
This is more see through than the old dri-fit shirts. Its also on the large side. Im usually between a small and medium and I got the small but it was still a bit large after a few rounds in the dryer on high. Pretty color though and seems like its made well.,,,,,,,
"i dont know what happened but I bought 2 dry-fit T shirts size L (I have one M and it is a little tight thats why I bought L), but what I received wasnt what I expected. I had to give them to my husband and they fit them ok.
I am in argentina so I cant sned them back.
It was a waste of money.",,,,,,,
Niceeee nicceeee shirt,,,,,,,
Love Nike gear,,,,,,,
good quality,,,,,,,
Good shirt!,,,,,,,
Not even the same shirt that was shown! The purple is actually a dark pinkish color not a deep purple like what is in the images and description. It doesnt have the nike logo on the front and it has mesh on the back and sides. Not at all what was shown in the pictures.,,,,,,,
The color. Was not what the web site showed.,,,,,,,
Great Shirt,,,,,,,
Arrived quickly and great price!,,,,,,,
Ordered the Royal blue . Its much much brighter than the picture. Also ordered an XS and is still too big. Cannot wear it for this race.,,,,,,,
Nice color,,,,,,,
Nice color - if you are looking for a fitted look this is not the shirt - I wear a medium and its a little big - but the small would have been to small,,,,,,,
Wonderful shirt! Looks great and feels better. My daughter typically wears a womens small to med.so we hot small and its still loose,,,,,,,
Love this shirt!! I use it for my gym workouts, very comfortable and goes with everything.,,,,,,
Nice fit and very light,,,,,,,
It was larger than I expected. I should have ordered a small one for next time. But overall its comfortable for workout so Im happy with it.,,,,,,,
I received this shirt the day after I ordered it! And then ordered it in another color because of how perfect it is,,,,,,,
I love this material. When I work out and wear this shirt I dont feel like it weighs me down when I sweat,,,,,,,
Nothing like last years Legend Tee which fit better and I liked the material better.,,,,,,,
Great condition,,,,,,,
Fits great, nice material!,,,,,,
Its bit large but I like that for my jiu jitsu class.. Good buy and fast delivery,,,,,,,
very bad quality......the logo not white,its gray logo......its exist in local market by 3 usd,,,,,,
You can find a better product fot that price, too expensive and not that great,,,,,,
Very nice,,,,,,,
Excellent fit! Quality fabric. Love the color. Holds up to frequent washing and drying. Couldnt be happier.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt!,,,,,,,
Perfect cut. Not too tight but has a feminine, not boxy, cut. Love it.,,,,,
Color is not as shown, fit is loose.,,,,,,
Wish it was just a bit bigger in width. But it is just what I wanted for looks. Very comfortable. I have washed it and it did not shrink.,,,,,,,
Perfect, it was a gift, She loved it,,,,,
Color is it even close to what is pictured. Its is not a bright gold/yellow.. its a dull tan/pale gold color,,,,,,,
This shirt is the only shirt I use for exercising. I have five of them and love them. The fit is perfect.,,,,,,,
perfect fit,,,,,,,
It wasnt as nice as the one with the same name (DriFit) purchased in a store; its a very thin material.,,,,,,,
Clearly not a real small!,,,,,,,
Great fit, true to size,,,,,,
arrived in time for Christmas. Fit perfectly.,,,,,,,
Arrived on time and exactly as described.,,,,,,,
Thinner than some of my other Nike tops but a good length. I would buy again!,,,,,,,
Fits my wife perfectly. Looks great and keeps you cool on hot days!,,,,,,,
Grandaughter loves it !,,,,,,,
Great length and light weight. True to color,,,,,,,
The fit was as expected. Im very happy with this shirt. Its soft, thick enough to not see through and long enough so I can go through airport security and raise my arms without showing my stomach. I love it,,,,,,
Great t-shirt but runs small. Very fit cut,,,,,,,
good, but I had a mistake when I choose the size, it is too long, it covered my hip,,,,
This is not yellow. It is beige. I like the shirt but dont order unless you want beige.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt feels great,,,,,,,
Love it,,,,,,,
Runs a tiny bit large but fast shipping and exactly what I was looking for,,,,,,,
Runs long, but happy to have senior rear covered.,,,,,,
Fitted as expected! Keeps me cool during a workout,,,,,,,
What i wanted,,,,,,,
Love it,,,,,,,
"i hate this shirt. it is NOT like my other Nike crew neck dry fit shirt.
they obviously discountinued the one i like because i cant find it anywhere.
this is not a fitted shirt. i wear a small( in a fitted shirt) this one fits baggy and loose and long.",,,,,,,
Great material and comfort,,,,,,,
ok,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,
Love it!!,,,,,,,
Very cool garment; will enjoy wearing it!,,,,,,,
I LOVE IT!,,,,,,,
Love it! Easy handling when traveling.,,,,,,,
Excellent product , highly recommended.,,,,,,
This is a nice basic workout t-shirt. It keeps you dry, fit well and is comfortable.,,,,,,
Great fit.,,,,,,,
I didnt like the quality!,,,,,,,
Love this,,,,,,,
Fits comfortably,,,,,,,
Very confortable,,,,,,,
Great top for soccer.,,,,,,,
Ok a bit long...,,,,,,,
Super large neck line,,,,,,,
I bought this shirt thinking the size would run large as thats what many of the reviews said. I did not feel that way about this shirt. I did not like the way it fit me. I am pretty broad and chesty and this shirt was definitely unflattering. It is made for very slim and petite women, not for me. I returned it immediately.,,,,,,
Bought this for my older sister as a christimas present. She loves it so much and commonly gets compliments on it! I plan on getting her a few more next christmas.,,,,,,,
Good as expected.,,,,,,,
Great feeling, rapids drying shirts. Planning a motorcycle trip and taking along a few of these. Rinse out at night and let hand dry.,,,,,,
Great fit, super comfortable, warm, but doesnt make you sweat. Its a perfect workout shirt or great for wearing under a jersey.,,,,
"I enjoy this shirt, as it works for what I intended it for. It was a little bigger than expected, bigger than many other ""Large"" shirts I have but not overly large. Its just a bit loose and a little thin, thats all. Works great though, as I use it as an undershirt in layering for the upper Midwest winters, as it can be quite cold up here. Comfortable, but it should be a bit cheaper, like $20 would be more acceptable. My main gripe is that Nike is really pushing it selling it for about $30 (for just a plain white t-shirt!) just because they can.",,,,,,,
This shirt is very nice, I bought the green one for my husband. The material is thinner but it falls and fits very nice, it does not cling. I highly recommend this shirt.,,,,,
These teet-shirts fit the way I wanted them to, for the size I thought. I have no problem ordering the way I had , thank you.,,,,,
Nice lightweight shirt. Great for working out, or wearing in the sun when you need extra coverage, but want to stay cool.,,,,,
some what too large but good quality sleeves a little too long also good quality so i gave it 3 stars no i would not buy again,,,,,,,
Great training shirt. Dont expect these to keep you warm as they are pretty thin, however they are very nice and soft and looks great. Its a somewhat fitted shirt, so make sure you dont have a tummy or it will show lol.,,,,,
My husband loves this Tee. He washes it in woolite and hang to dry. Last a long time!,,,,,,,
Comfortable, but like any other white workout shirt, will stain with sunscreen.,,,,,
My significant other was very happy with the material of this shirt and it fit perfect,,,,,,,
The sizes run smaller than most, had to return it. Sorry to say they didnt have same in larger sizes.,,,,,,
Excellent quality and price. Fit perfectly. My husband love it.,,,,,,,
Cheap quality with thin material. Not happy with what I got for the price.,,,,,,,
Warm yet cool, looks fresh and feels great. No issues, fits well.,,,,,
Needed a purple shirt. This was a great choice.,,,,,,,
Great Fit! Perfect Wash and Wear!!,,,,,,,
Son loves it. He looks good in it,,,,,,,
Great product, great seller!!!,,,,,,
Im slightly disappointed because the image I viewed appeared that the product faded from a washed out purple to a saturated purple below the shoulders. I referenced the same image while writing this review and have determined that flood lighting is creating a washed out effect on the promotional image. I used the item as a wind breaker over a sweat shirt for a team event that required a purple shirt. I will normally use it as a winter running shirt.,,,,,,,
too big not matter what size,,,,,,,
love the design and fit,,,,,,,
A little bit longer on sleeves than hope for but all in all great!,,,,,,,
nice shirt, comfy and well made,,,,,,
Looks great and fits well,,,,,,,
a gift and was loved,,,,,,,
Another satisfied customer,,,,,,,
Fits great. Extra coverage to keep the sun off during the long runs. Easy clean. Love it!,,,,,,,
Got it for our son-in-law for Christmas - he loved it and has worn it several times!,,,,,,,
Great color and size is a good fit. Happy with purchase.,,,,,,,
Fantastic product. Im absolutely in love with Nike Dri-Fit products,,,,,,,
I got this shirt as a gift for my boyfriend and he really likes it. It fits as expected and he likes that its light on him while he runs. Very timely shipping!,,,,,,,
I purchased one of these in hope of finding something that is light enough to wear and use at the gym, but still thick enough to where my nips wouldnt be popping out the whole time. Im pleased with the buy. The quality is great. Im 511 and weigh about 165-70. I went with a large and am happy i did so. Wear a tank top underneath though. If your gym is cold your nips mighy show.,,,,,,
Very good quality. Great value.,,,,,,,
Fits nice and feels good.,,,,,,,
Comfy,,,,,,,
Excellent product, price and shipping,,,,,,
Fits perfect,,,,,,,
Nice shirt. I have one in gray and now this one in white. I like the fit, i.e., not baggy, and the thinness of the fabric. Other brands are thicker, and I find that makes me too hot while exercising. Also great to wear in the sun.,,,
Bought this for my son and he loves it! Fits as expected!,,,,,,,
This is made in Mexico. The Vietnam fabric is much better.,,,,,,,
I liked this Nike long sleeve a lot.,,,,,,,
Too large,,,,,,,
Great,,,,,,,
I got the large. It looks great, however really is....welll.... quite large. I am 6 feet tall, around 200 pounds with a relatively athletic physique and this is still quite a bit too big on me. Feels more like an extra large. Insanely comfortable though and it still looks great. I would just size down if at all possible.,,,,,
I bought this shirt for longer runs (10+ miles) here in Central Florida on days when it is typically over 90 degrees and over 90% humidity. It definitely makes a difference with the white color as it is highly reflective and keeps you cooler in that regard. Secondly, you are now evaporating sweat from both your skin and the shirt, creating a better core temp cooling mechanism. I recommend.,,,,,
Super super comfortable an awesome looking but the only problem is when you order a large it comes in a slightly smaller size so its not Amazons fault, but rather Nikes for making a shirt and not giving it the proper size but overall still a great purchase and a goal to work towards,,,,,,
The long sleeves feels good but the size are a little bigger then what I ordered. I wear a medium but when I put this on, it feels and look a little bigger then medium but a little smaller then a large.,,,,,,
"Great breathable and ultra-light running shirt! The fit for the M is spot on for someone bw around 510 - 62"", with decent chest room (ie not too snug)",,,,,,,
"Comfortable dry-fit long sleeve t-shirt.
Fits well on medium frame-size.
Made in Jordan.",,,,,,,
great for the gym!,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,
Ive bought several of these. Their great to work out in or to lounge around in.,,,,,,,
bought this for a co-worker for secret santa. bought him a medium but it fits like a large. He still uses it though :) shipped and delivered on time,,,,,,,
"This was ordered for my very thin grandson. He usually wears a mens small, but this was still a bit loose in the small, but he still likes it.
",,,,,,,
100f outside and this long sleeve is keeping me cool, love thus shirt buying more,,,,,,
Fits well like to wear to the gym with my Nike Mens Free Trainer 3.0 V3 Training Shoe [Color: Game Royal/White] its a perfect match. When you running keeps the sweat under control. This way when you leave the gym you arent exposed to the cold air. I have few brands of shirts, but actually find these the most comfortable.,,,,,,
Just as you would expect. But smaller than most. Would get the next size up,,,,,,,
"Nice fit
not see through own two",,,,,,,
shirt feels very good on skin. keeps you cool and fits as expected,,,,,,,
I would recommend. Love the fit and color. No surprises here.,,,,,,,
Very good shirt made with nice expensive looking material. The shirt fits very well. I purchased the purple because most of the other colors were sold out in large. I was skeptical of the color because its purple. However, the shirt looks really good on.,,,,,,
Bought it for a Christmas gift & they loved it,,,,,,,
great shirt - fits accordingly and looks great - highly recommend,,,,,,,
"I ordered size M, its a little tight around chest, sending it back.

The material is dri-fit, very thin, but durable, not too bad for $32 I paid.",,,,,,,
A little oversized, decent quality.,,,,,,
I love this ! I would buy more!,,,,,,,
Nice color and fit,,,,,,,
Came in as red and not maroon my boyfriend ended up keeping it but now he has two of the same color,,,,,,,
Dont typically buy clothing from Amazon, but my husband has a NIKE Black long sleeve crew and wanted a white one. The size is accurate.,,,,,,
The outside tag said Large but when tried on realized it was very tight. The inside tag showed it was a small.,,,,,,,
exelent,,,,,,,
some of these run so small like they are meant for undershirts or workout only but this is a good shirt for relaxing or casual wear no form fitting,,,,,,,
I bought this lightweight dry fit for my husband to wear to the gym. He loves it. It provides extra warmth under his t shirt because our gym is always freezing cold. I bought a medium, he weighs about 165 and is 5 10 and it fits true to size.,,,,,,
great!!!,,,,,,,
Got for my father-in-law for Christmas, who usually wears a Tall, and it fit very well. He loved it so much he wore it two days in a row! LOL!,,,,,
Nice Shirt.,,,,,,,
Great fit and quality, exactly what I needed,,,,,,
Fits well throughout chest and back etc. Was expecting more of a tight fit through the arms however and wrists, however. All in all a great shirt though.,,,,,,
Great purchase. Im 62 200 pounds and ordered a large. The shirt fits great and came MUCH faster than the ETA,,,,,,,
The upper part of the sleeves are oddly baggy, while the lower forearm fits as expected. My husband isnt really a fan of it, but I think I will try to alter it so the upper arms fit more like they should.,,,,,
Great shirt for the price....Very comfortable!,,,,,,,
I was very disappointed. It was thinner and more see-through than the picture depicted. I will just use it as an undershirt on a cold day.,,,,,,,
Arrived on time and looks okay - not really impressed with the material and it had a weird smell to it when it first arrived.,,,,,,,
you can buy it at the same price outside.,,,,,,,
I bought two of these and love them. Loose fitting and lightweight. Perfect for working, hiking/camping, or just lounging around the house.,,,,,
Fits beautifully,,,,,,,
Love this shirt. Excellent for working out in or just casual wear.,,,,,,,
I have three of these all different colors. Ordered them from the same place. Fast shipping! Will buy a few more in different colors soon.,,,,,,,
"A gift for my hubby, He is 511"" 173lbs, I got him size L. It fits well.",,,,,,,
Bought it for my husband, looks And fits great,,,,,,
It was perfect just what my grandson wanted. The fit was just right, the purple was a beautiful color. Very pleased.,,,,,,
Perfect fit, great for running.,,,,,,
For some reason this fabric snags very easily on velcro. (the hook side). I have a dozen of these NikeFit that I bought years ago that dont do that.,,,,,,,
Bit larger than description.,,,,,,,
These are sized a little bigger than you would think or are used too. But the quality is still the NIKE quality. I would easy buy again.,,,,,,,
An excellent & interesting transaction,,,,,,,
Dri-Fit T-shirts are a great idea. I wear it when I play tennis in the sun to keep the sun off of my arms. It is great!,,,,,,,
I really love this as a long sleeve under shirt, under my golf polo shirts. Or can be worn as an outer shirt, its not very heavy, very light breathable material,,,,
"Great fit , exactly as described, fast delivery
I would order from this seller again",,,,,,,
My husband loves these shirts for running in the winter. Bought as a Christmas present.,,,,,,,
"I bought this t-shirt for my daughters boy friend he loved it.
Beautiful blue",,,,,,,
My husband really likes these shirts and this one is one of his favorites. Its thin enough to wear underneath a sweatshirt/fleece or to layer over a tshirt. Dri-fit material.,,,,,,,
It is great and my nephew loved it, the material was comfortable and the fit was good,,,,,,
Bought as a gift for my brother - he loves it! Stated is was comfortable and washed great. He is tall and has broad shoulders - fit great all the way around.,,,,,,,
Perfect shirt if you are running outdoors in the winter or late fall. It fits loose and is very comfortable! I would definitely reccommend this product.,,,,,,,
Great shirt, cool, nice material. Fits a littler big but is great for exercising when it is not that hot out.,,,,,
I rock one of these in a different color at least 5 days a week. Theyre legit af,,,,,,,
Arms are a bit tight where they attach to the body. Otherwise fits as expected.,,,,,,,
All perfect, thanks!!!!,,,,,,
Was not what i expected, please be careful of what the item description says and what your expectations are.,,,,,,
??,,,,,,,
Slow ship but worth the wait.,,,,,,,
I am somewhat dissapointed with how dark the color of the shirt is .,,,,,,,
Great long sleeve running shirt. Ive owned these before so no big surprise.,,,,,,,
Nike is still the best dry fit weave available, Ive bought adidas and others but they can be scratchy.,,,,,,
This shirt will get you hella chicks,,,,,,,
Too thin !Long sleeves!,,,,,,,
Fits perfectly and material is light for late spring/early fall weather in the mid-west.,,,,,,,
You get what you pay for. Very thin, badly fitting shirt,,,,,,
Fits good, but this is way light weight. In fact you can see right thought this shirt? For the price I thought it would be higher quality Nike.,,,,,,
Nice quality and good finishing as well. If you have an athletic body type this would look perfect. I use these for gym and dont feel sweaty.,,,,,,,
Bought a medium; small would probably be the right fit,,,,,,,
Fits just as expected. Im very happy with my purchase,,,,,,,
Great color,though i wish the swoosh was embroidered..,,,,,,
Ive bought several of these & they are a good look & so comfortable!,,,,,,,
"It isnt made of the same material as the ""Nike Dri-fit"". The item is also too small.
Not happy with this purchase.",,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
I was skeptical, but believe all the other reviewers now- this runs really a size or size and a half big. I usually wear a L, but this was the biggest, longest M Ive ever seen!,,,,
Fits perfectly. Feels great in the heat considering I walk all day as a letter carrier.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt, fits very good. Like the fabric. Will be good sun protection without being too hot.,,,,,,
I like the color, the fit, the weight (perfect for coolish summer days).,,,,,
Loved it!,,,,,,,
Awesome shirt and fits as expected..,,,,,,,
Loose sleeves exactly what I wanted for bug protection.,,,,,,,
Fits slightly bigger than expected, but great product. Exactly what I was looking for!,,,,,,
Light and dry feel.,,,,,,,
My husband likes this shirt a lot,,,,,,,
The material is strange. Tends to hold body odor and doesnt breathe well. Not liking it so far,,,,,,,
Grandson was very proud of it.,,,,,,,
great fit, just what i wanted,,,,,,
very nice fit true to sizing,,,,,,,
Shirt fits loosely, but is true to size.,,,,,,
Shirt was the perfect gift.,,,,,,,
Good shirt but doesnt fit as expected.,,,,,,,

Bought this as a gift for a friend at the gym. He loved it and it fits him great.,,,,,,,

Its a nice shirt, but it was for my 13 year old son and it almost fits my husband who wears a large.,,,,,,

Very good Dri-Fit long sleeve shirt for running in cool weather.,,,,,,,
Absolutely Perfect!!,,,,,,,
Good quality...good fit.....nice material for a trip as it is easy to clean,,,,,,,
great shirt, very comfortable and form fitting,,,,,,
These shirts are great for working out. Keeps you dry and very comfortable. I have used them for hiking in cold weather as well as an undershirt to wick sweat away.,,,,,,,
Item as described,,,,,,,
Awesome like all things Nike. The only thing is the neck line runs a little loose for my liking. A thicker seam on the neckline would make this shirt perfect.,,,,,,,
Shirt fit as expected and was the exact shade of red I wanted.,,,,,,,
Fits well, easy to wrestle in and work out in,,,,,,
fits great,,,,,,,

Great fit; light weight .Perfect to work out in which was just what he wanted.,,,,,,,
This shirt is great for warming up, light workouts, or running outside/on the treadmill. It fits really well, and is thin so it is very breathable.,,,,
Extraordinarily thin material. Maybe thats the way it is supposed to be.,,,,,,,
Very good,,,,,,,

#swag,,,,,,,

It fit well.,,,,,,,
Fast shipping. Exactly what i wanted,,,,,,,
Shirt fits very well, is very soft and comfortable. I ordered a few more in other colors. Good for exercising.,,,,,,
as expected,,,,,,,
fits great,,,,,,,
Ordered a size small...it was huge...and I am 5.10 and 150 LBs...,,,,,,,
Love these Nike Dri-Fit crew tops. Long sleeve or short sleeve they make for great casual shirts or workout shirts. Theyre breathable, durable, and fashionable. The heather grey color is my favorite. I bought this one to replace the one I let my friend borrow(which he has yet to return). Great product!,,,,,
My son wanted to purchase this. While I felt it was a bit overpriced, he was very happy with it. The material is very breathable.,,,,,,
Bought it for my husband. He loves these dry-fit tees and wanted this color. He was somewhat disappointed because it fit him larger than the other long sleeve dry-fit Nike tees that he has bought in the past. For future buyers, I recommend buying a size smaller.,,,,,,
Fit perfect - large as expected. Great material that dries quick.,,,,,,,
is bad,,,,,,,
I use this for golf when I go to practice and occasionally play. Feels great in Texas summers at 100+ degree heat. Usually a concern for me is how see threw the white is but I have not had that problem with this product! Am going to buy more and get a polo version as well,,,,,,,
This is a nice product, but the arms are very long compared with the body. If you need a shirt for a bigger body, but dont have particularly long arms, you may want to look at other similar products.,,,,
It doesnt feel like a Nike product. Looks like a cheap rip off.,,,,,,,
Solid shirt. I got this item for the gym but I also wear it when Im not in the gym. It is light so it is very breathable. I have a few short sleeve versions of this shirt but I think Ill be getting more of these in the future.,,,,,,,
"Really like the shirt but it definitely runs large. I am 62"" and the sleeves are long and the neck opening is larger than I would like. Really wish I had ordered a size smaller but stuck with an expensive t-shirt.",,,,,,,
Fit perfectly,,,,,,,
Very nice fit, color very true to picture and size was very accurate, my husband loved it,,,,,
The only problem I have is that I paid 30 dollars for a 28 dollar shirt. Thats what it said on the tag !! I should have looked further for a better deal !!,,,,,,,
I would advise anyone purchasing to order a size down. I ordered a medium and it looks like a large plus its a very loose material so that makes it even bigger fitting.,,,,,,,
My husband really likes this shirt however it swallows him. And the sleeves are long. Still giving 4 stars because for someone that it fits it would be perfect.,,,,,,,
This is a nice shirt for working out or casual wear. It is really thin material so can be worn in summer too. It fits nice, not super tight but like a t-shirt.,,,,,,
The shirt arrived quickly, and his extremely comfortable. I recommend this product for anyone that is interested in being comfortable while working out.,,,,,,
Everything arrived on time and in good condition. Great product for working out - exactly what I was hoping for / expected. Happy with my purchase,,,,,,,
He said its light weight very comfortable. As for me the wash, Can wear right out of dryer and its looks brand new. I bought all colors for him.,,,,,,
"The material is cheap. Not what I expected from reading the reviews. Ive bought actual Nike ""dri-fit"" from Nike and those were actually very durable and warm. This material is very thin. If you want it just for looks for the gym, I guess its ok but for its purpose -dont buy",,,,,,,
It doesnt seem authentic. It was huge. Small fit like a large. Material isnt similar to Nikes shirts.,,,,,,,
To large for me,,,,,,,
I ordered an XL and I received an XL Tall. Does not fit well at all. Product is not as described.,,,,,,,
Great it is exactly what I ordered.....great product and great price, would order more of these in the future for sure,,,,,,
The shirt was a little too big but I still use it. It works great and worth the price I paid.,,,,,,,
Excellent quality. My grandson loved it and it looked great on him. Very pleased.,,,,,,,
S Size was a bit large and wide for me in the sleeves, but still being a good product!,,,,,,
this product is very good, apart from their arrival shipping services consider them the best,,,,,,
Good fit and so far good quality to resistance to wear and tear,,,,,,,
No comment,,,,,,,
Nice Long Sleeve!,,,,,,,
great product snd customer service,,,,,,,
Its ok,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
Dont buy it. When i saw this first time in my eyes, i couldnt believe my eyes. I ordered T-shirt not dress. So I measured this stupid long bodied T-shirt, it was 29.5 inches. How can man have a body lengths of 29.5 inches? Besides the fact that i am Asian, this T-shirt is way too long.,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
I was expecting more of an under armor type of shirt. you know, tightly fit on the sleeves to show off biceps.? A bit loose on the arms and short in length of the entire shirt. fits kind of awkward for my taste. Good material though.,,,,,,
I hate the fit as that the large fits like a normal x-large. Something was wrong with the sizing.,,,,,,,
About 100% sure this shirt isnt a real Nike Dri-Fit. I own about 4 different Dri-fits and this one is counterfeit. The Nike swoosh looks and feels fake, the fabric doesnt feel like a Dri fit.,,,,,,
Excelente. Continuaré comprando a este vendedor. Tienda recomendada para hacer más compras internacionales. GRACIAS POR LA VENTA DEL PRODUCTO. SALUDOS,,,,,,,
Comfy sweater especially for work in the spring and fall,,,,,,,
I initially ordered a couple of these Nike long sleeve shirts in a couple of colors to check out the quality of the material and the workmanship. Some people had posted that the shirts were too sheer and too light for their use. All I can say is that these shirts are my new faves for working out and for wearing under quarter zip pullover shirts. I think I have ordered a total of six or seven of these shirts in various colors and I was actually contemplating ordering a few more when amazon sent an email message asking me to post a review on these shirts. The shirts are generously sized. The material is high quality and is very comfortable next to my skin, unlike some of my other long sleeve work out shirts. The workmanship is excellent. They come in a wide variety of colors. And, they are only +/- $25.00 each. Believe me, you will not be disappointed. These shirts are a great value. Enjoy... and just do it !!,,,,
This dri fit shirt is made of very very thin/fine fabric. It completely takes to the shape of your body. So unless youve got a banging body this might not be the shirt for you. The other dri fit materials are made of a hardier fabric that can kind of keep their shape. I didnt like this one because of the fit. But if youre a runner looking for a next to naked feeling dri fit shirt, this might be the shirt for you.,,,,,,
Nice shirt. I normally wear an x-lg t-shirt, so I got this in an x-lg as well, but I wish I had opted for a large. This kind of shirt wasnt meant to be this loose. My fault, though, so Im still giving it 5-stars. I guess Ill get another, but in large, and Ill just wear this one while doing yard-work or something. Id recommend you guys to consider getting a size smaller than usual.,
"Found my new favorite shirt(s) can wear it for a run or out to eat and very comfortable. Fits good 5""10 165 lbs size large (maybe a tad loose but not bad) very thin though. Nike makes a version 2.0 to this shirt that has some cotton rather than 100% poly that I like better but still love this shirt.",,,,,,,
"really low quality material for this shirt I was expecting something way better for the price and the Nike brand although Im doubting if its actually legit. The Nike logo isnt reflective neither the ""Dri-Fit"" something I found weird because if you look closely to the other shirts they say NikeFit. My chest is quite visble with this tshirt something that Im not a fan though and I used and sweated it and it doesnt dry as my other Nike or whatever other sport brand tshirt. Sadly Im not in the US otherwise Id ask for a refund.

This review isnt biased. Nobody is paying to talk about the crappy product I bought is just a customers opinion about a con over a ""Nike"" shirt. Sad

Here are some pictures of the product.",,,,,,,
"I bought this shirt b/c I wanted a long sleeve shirt to wear around the house that wasnt too warm. This works perfectly. Its light, cool, and extremely comfortable.

Regarding the size, Im 60 and weight 230. I tend to buy XXL size shirts, but on the suggestion of other reviews, I ordered an XL. The fit is perfect, which is to say that any purchasers should also consider ordering a size smaller than normal.",,,,,,,
"The fabric is thin but nice, its overall a good looking shirt, but I have to return it since it was far too large. I normally order medium (I am 5 10.5), but I ordered small (which is the smallest size available) based on the reviews. Both the shirt and the sleeves are about 1 longer than the maximum that I would tolerate. There is also a lot of extra fabric under the armpits and the shirt fits pretty loosely, so I would just order 1-2 sizes smaller if that was possible. The shirt label says ""S"", so I was sent the correct size.",,,,,,,
Very cheap shirt, not like the photo what so ever. Im not sure why so much good reviews but its the only reason I thought i was getting a nice shirt which is cheap looking shirt, the only reason for the two starts is the super fast shipping!! Not worth the money! Believe me....,,,,,
"Great shirt. Love the material and feel. I usually get a large, but purchased med because of reviews. Fits good but I like shirts to be a little more loose. Going to order a couple more but large this time. Im 510, 180.

11-16-15 I ordered 2 more. I am LE and wear under my uniform. Hold up well and very comfortable.",,,,,,,
"I bought these shirts in 2014 and my initial response to these shirts was they were fantastic. All the seams l lie flat inside and out. Fit was good felt great on so long as I only wore them short term. So for fit and quality of manufacture they would get 5 stars, but this is 2016 and I believe there are some other considerations and technologies that should be added to this type of shirt. I used these shirts as I worked maintenance for a condo and later as a pest control technician.

Having anti-odor/Anti-microbial technology made into the shirt didnt seem that important when I bought these items. However, it has to be if you need to wear a shirt made with this type of fabric longer than a few hours. When I wore these shirts under my short sleeve work shirt they became foul smelling on long hot days. I thought it might be me forgetting deodorant or something, I even carried a spare stick in my truck. After I switched to another brand with anti-odor/Anti-microbial properties I didnt have the odor issues I had with the Nike Dry Fit. So this consideration is rated by me a critical fail.

Additionally these are not advertised as having any sun protection capability, another component I need here in NW Florida. I now wear this type of shirt to play tennis to try to stay cool in the summer and get some protection from the sun to make my dermatologist happy. I want to avoid sunscreen so it doesnt mess up my grip on the racquet. After wearing these shirts for nearly a year my dermatologist treated and area in the middle of my back. Hence my renewed interest in UPF shirts. Again this area is rated by me as a critical fail.

Bottom Line: Just dont, I have to replace these Nike Dry Fit shirts to get the anti-odor/Anti-microbial and UPF 50 capabilities available in other shirts so I wasted my money on Nike. Im trying the Vapor Apparel Mens UPF Long Sleeve Solar Performance T-Shirt as a replacement.",,,,,,,
The Nike Mens Legend Poly Long Sleeve Dri-Fit T-shirt arrived within the scheduled time frame and was exactly as described on the site. It fits well, is very comfortable and I would recommend it to anyone that either works out or, wants to wear it as a long sleeved shirt under a short sleeved shirt.,,,,,
The sleeves are so long. Im 60. 165lbs. I wear an XL. The sleeves hang past my hands about 3-4 inches.,,,,,,,
"I bought this shirt from another site since it was a lot cheaper.

The shirt definitely runs large. Im 510"", 170 lbs, and usually wear mediums for Nike shirts, and they arent too loose on me. I bought a small of this shirt and it fits me very well, you could maybe even say its a little baggy, which is fine with me.

The shirt is thin, made to wear in the summer or for workouts, not the best to keep warm.

However, the shirt is very comfortable and its not too thin that you can see through it.",,,,,,,
This is a nice quality shirt, especially if you order the right size. I ordered it for my husband who is small in stature. He is 5ft. 7 and 150 pounds. I ordered a medium and it fits him very well. He loved the shirt so much that I ordered another one in Maroon. Unfortunately, they sent me the red which is why I only gave four stars as opposed to five. The only reason why I didnt send it back is because my husband decided to go ahead and keep the red even though that is not the color I wanted.,,,,,
Very nice fit and feel.Well made. Its a kind of a semi-mesh fabric that looks to be breathable. Would buy another one anytime soon. Im pleased with my purchase.,,,,,,,
"The picture of the product shows a Nike check.
Be aware the shirt may not have a Nike check.
As seen below, mine did not.",,,,,,,
"PRICED ABOVE MSRP. First thing first. These are Overpriced. This particular Nike Dri-Fit Training shirt has an MSRP of $22 (see picture of the tag from the green shirt for $22 and I paid $24 for it) and most of them listed here are going for $22-$30. That is ridiculous. You can go to Dicks Sporting Goods website and get them for $16.50. I ordered two of these shirts in red and green size XL for $23 and $24 respectively. The only reason I ordered these is because I thought they were the Dri-Fit Ts that normally retail for ~$35 and I thought I was getting a good deal. I have two of the $35 dri-fit t-shirts already, which fit really nice (not tight, I hate tight shirts, but not loose). These cheaper dri-fit t-shirts fit much larger than the $35 ones (see picture red $22 MSRP from amazon on left and navy $35 MSRP from Dicks on right, both XL). I am 63"", 230 lbs and the XL feels like I am wearing a dress.

I will be returning these shirts. I paid too much for what they actually are, and on top of that the fit is a little on the large size. There is no problem with the shirts quality wise, besides the larger fit. But if you do want one of these, do yourself a favor and dont order from here. Order it from Dicks for $16.50.",,,,,,,
"Fantastic product, the high quality stuff you expect from Nike.

Fits a tad large, but this is a performance shirt, so the idea behind it is to remove swear from the body and dry out. Dont expect this to hug at all, its meant to be a tad loose.

Awesome for warmer climates and situations where you gotta sweat but stay cool!",,,,,,,
Nice, comfortable shirt. I wear it playing tennis, jogging, boating, or just out running errands. It does seem to run a bit large, and long, but not so bad that I dont like it. I have several colors, and it is odd that they have such a wide range of prices. White was cheapest.
Im such a big fan of this running and workout shirt. It wicks moisture very well. I actually use it for hiking to keep my body cool, especially as a base layer during the spring or early fall.,,,,,,
The Nike Mens Legend shirt fit great for my son. He used it at summer camp as he was part of the purple cabin. He wore the shirt for all types of activities including game time, lunch/dinner, free time and various sporting events. The shirt did a great job wicking moisture away from his body and provided great protection from the elements. I would recommend this shirt as a great outdoor/indoor activity shirt.,,,,,
Nice fit and wears as advertised. Dri material retains slight smell after a few wears and washes. Does seem to go away after a deep soak and cleanse.,,,,,,,
Awesome and comfortable shirt! I wear when working out, playing tennis, and just around the house. Good price as well!,,,,,
This particular shirt came quite a bit larger than my other Medium Nike Dri-Fits. I noticed they were all made in different countries, so that might be the issue. Ill try and buy these shirts from local stores to make sure its the nice tight fit I was hoping for.,,,,,,
"Not yellow
It is a puke color and it was wadded up in the package
Don’t think it’s original nike",,,,,,,
Definitely great and authentic Nike quality, but a bit too large. Ordered a 2x, and its seriously huge.,,,,,
Quality is good but its extremely LARGE. Im 60 220pounds and the size large was dancing over my body,,,,,,,
Comfortable and fits well. I bought it late spring and have only worn it for a short run, but it breathed well. Would highly recommend it.,,,,,,
Purchased them for my daughter in law and she loves them. Very well made.,,,,,,,
fav longsleeve to work out it. i got the red/burgandy and always get compliments on the color,,,,,,,
Perfect Shirt, I love the high quality and it is very comfortable and light for the summer! I gave 4 stars because is a little large for me.,,,,,,
Great sports gear and my daughter loves them.,,,,,,,
It is an excellent product,,,,,,,
PERFECT ORANGE & FITS GREAT!,,,,,,,
Great looking casual shirt,,,,,,,
Very nice warm weather top for active sports.,,,,,,,
very thin fabric,,,,,,,
As noted, fit the person it was for great.,,,,,,
nice,,,,,,,
Just received the shirts and they fit as expected. Im very happy.,,,,,,,
XS is good fit but sleeves were too tight.,,,,,,,
I got this shirt today and I made the mistake to go by the size chart! Im 5ft 137lbs and according to the chart Im large but is way-way too big on me, Im returning this item.,,,,,,
I didnt realize this shirt was sheer. Super disappointed. I thought Id be able to wear it out for running errands & working out, but now I have to send it back.,,,,,,
Itchy... material not soft.,,,,,,,
Perfect for what I needed,,,,,,,
Cotton material, NOT dri-fit material. Not tight and I got an XS. Still a cute shirt but,,,,,,
Perfect,,,,,,,
I ordered a extra Large like all my others. This seems to run way small. Order up a size or two.,,,,,,,
I wear this every Monday Wednesday and Friday when I work on my upper body, it feels great! I love how it feels, I dont feel all nasty and wet and feel like my clothes is sticking to my body after Im done with my work out, not tight nice and loose, some people might not like it like that but I do, I recommend if you want it a little tight then get a size lower, I got the size I wear on my regular shirts and it was a little big but I like it like that.,
My husband loves these shirts!,,,,,,,
"The fit is good and I think for most people these would be perfect. I find I am always between sizes and this is no exception. My shoulders stick out a bit more than I would desire and the neck and arm holes are snug. I am 6 and weigh 175 43"" chest, 33"" waist so finding clothes is hard for me. Nonetheless these are high quality shirts that I will happily wear. They are a bit pricey for a sleeveless tee but they are Nike.",,,,,,,
"Fit was great, love the color, husband liked the ""muscle t"" look with the wider tank straps.",,,,,,,
super comfortable shirt,,,,,,,
Fits well and feels good,,,,,,,
Great shirt,,,,,,,
The shirt is fine but I got a medium and it is a little large. If you like your workout shirts a little looser than this is a good choice.,,,,,,,
I am very disappointed by the quality of this T shirt. It has a low quality material and does not compare to other Nike Dri-Fit clothing which we have bought in the past. After washing it once following the instructions it came out of the washer all fluffy with lots of lints on it (see the attached photo). I would not recommend buying it if you are looking for a good quality Dri-Fit T.,,,,,,,
I ordered a extra Large like all my others. This seems to run way small. Order up a size or two.,,,,,,,
I wear this every Monday Wednesday and Friday when I work on my upper body, it feels great! I love how it feels, I dont feel all nasty and wet and feel like my clothes is sticking to my body after Im done with my work out, not tight nice and loose, some people might not like it like that but I do, I recommend if you want it a little tight then get a size lower, I got the size I wear on my regular shirts and it was a little big but I like it like that.,
My husband loves these shirts!,,,,,,,

This fits differently than my original Dri-Fit shirt, which I love. The shoulders are smaller, the material is different and a lighter weight (a little bit of see-through), and the torso is blousier. If you have broad or muscley shoulders, it will feel a bit tight. Overall weird fit for me.,,,
Seems to be cheaper material than Nikes other dry-fit shirts. A little long and loose around the waist, but I prefer that over being tight.,,,,,,
Will defiantly be replacing all my casual shirts with these in every color. Very nice material breaths well without being see through. Streatchy so very comfortable and perfect for outdoor activities and exercising drys quick exactly what it was supposed to do!,,,,,,,
I am a plus size after having a baby. I read the reviews of all those who said it ran large. I usually size up when buying online but due to those reviews I bought my usual size. This thing does not run big..,,,,,,,
The image is of a sports bra rather than of the black shirt I got for workouts.,,,,,,,
Fit really small but love the feel of the material wish it wouldve fit right,,,,,,,
"Great shirt for the gym. The M fit is somewhat loose, which I expected for the style.

Two stars because this shirt retails at $24.99 on the tag. Theyre selling at a premium.

My advice, wait until the price drops to at least $20 to get a better deal or run out to the nearest sporting goods store and buy one on sale at a retail store.",,,,,,,
I dont like to wear tight clothing when I run, but this was too big.,,,,,,
Excellent fit and the material dries fast. Great value and great design for workout or even casual wear.,,,,,,,
1.5 sizes too big but wearable. If wear a medium maybe opt for a small.,,,,,,,
Fit well and tighter than the Nike Womens Miler Short sleeve top,,,,,,,
Love this, its light weight and not clingy. I will be ordering again...,,,,,,
Comfy, however, little thick (warm) for summers,,,,,
This is more see through than the old dri-fit shirts. Its also on the large side. Im usually between a small and medium and I got the small but it was still a bit large after a few rounds in the dryer on high. Pretty color though and seems like its made well.,,,,,,,
"i dont know what happened but I bought 2 dry-fit T shirts size L (I have one M and it is a little tight thats why I bought L), but what I received wasnt what I expected. I had to give them to my husband and they fit them ok.
I am in argentina so I cant sned them back.
It was a waste of money.",,,,,,,
Niceeee nicceeee shirt,,,,,,,
Love Nike gear,,,,,,,
good quality,,,,,,,
Good shirt!,,,,,,,
Not even the same shirt that was shown! The purple is actually a dark pinkish color not a deep purple like what is in the images and description. It doesnt have the nike logo on the front and it has mesh on the back and sides. Not at all what was shown in the pictures.,,,,,,,
The color. Was not what the web site showed.,,,,,,,
Great Shirt,,,,,,,
Arrived quickly and great price!,,,,,,,
Ordered the Royal blue . Its much much brighter than the picture. Also ordered an XS and is still too big. Cannot wear it for this race.,,,,,,,
Nice color,,,,,,,
Nice color - if you are looking for a fitted look this is not the shirt - I wear a medium and its a little big - but the small would have been to small,,,,,,,
Wonderful shirt! Looks great and feels better. My daughter typically wears a womens small to med.so we hot small and its still loose,,,,,,,
Love this shirt!! I use it for my gym workouts, very comfortable and goes with everything.,,,,,,
Nice fit and very light,,,,,,,
It was larger than I expected. I should have ordered a small one for next time. But overall its comfortable for workout so Im happy with it.,,,,,,,
I received this shirt the day after I ordered it! And then ordered it in another color because of how perfect it is,,,,,,,
I love this material. When I work out and wear this shirt I dont feel like it weighs me down when I sweat,,,,,,,
Nothing like last years Legend Tee which fit better and I liked the material better.,,,,,,,
Great condition,,,,,,,
Fits great, nice material!,,,,,,
Its bit large but I like that for my jiu jitsu class.. Good buy and fast delivery,,,,,,,
very bad quality......the logo not white,its gray logo......its exist in local market by 3 usd,,,,,,
You can find a better product fot that price, too expensive and not that great,,,,,,
Very nice,,,,,,,
Excellent fit! Quality fabric. Love the color. Holds up to frequent washing and drying. Couldnt be happier.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt!,,,,,,,
Perfect cut. Not too tight but has a feminine, not boxy, cut. Love it.,,,,,
Color is not as shown, fit is loose.,,,,,,
Wish it was just a bit bigger in width. But it is just what I wanted for looks. Very comfortable. I have washed it and it did not shrink.,,,,,,,
Perfect, it was a gift, She loved it,,,,,
Color is it even close to what is pictured. Its is not a bright gold/yellow.. its a dull tan/pale gold color,,,,,,,
This shirt is the only shirt I use for exercising. I have five of them and love them. The fit is perfect.,,,,,,,
perfect fit,,,,,,,
It wasnt as nice as the one with the same name (DriFit) purchased in a store; its a very thin material.,,,,,,,
Clearly not a real small!,,,,,,,
Great fit, true to size,,,,,,
arrived in time for Christmas. Fit perfectly.,,,,,,,
Arrived on time and exactly as described.,,,,,,,
Thinner than some of my other Nike tops but a good length. I would buy again!,,,,,,,
Fits my wife perfectly. Looks great and keeps you cool on hot days!,,,,,,,
Grandaughter loves it !,,,,,,,
Great length and light weight. True to color,,,,,,,
The fit was as expected. Im very happy with this shirt. Its soft, thick enough to not see through and long enough so I can go through airport security and raise my arms without showing my stomach. I love it,,,,,,
Great t-shirt but runs small. Very fit cut,,,,,,,
good, but I had a mistake when I choose the size, it is too long, it covered my hip,,,,
This is not yellow. It is beige. I like the shirt but dont order unless you want beige.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt feels great,,,,,,,
Love it,,,,,,,
Runs a tiny bit large but fast shipping and exactly what I was looking for,,,,,,,
Runs long, but happy to have senior rear covered.,,,,,,
Fitted as expected! Keeps me cool during a workout,,,,,,,
What i wanted,,,,,,,
Love it,,,,,,,
"i hate this shirt. it is NOT like my other Nike crew neck dry fit shirt.
they obviously discountinued the one i like because i cant find it anywhere.
this is not a fitted shirt. i wear a small( in a fitted shirt) this one fits baggy and loose and long.",,,,,,,
Great material and comfort,,,,,,,
ok,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,
Love it!!,,,,,,,
Very cool garment; will enjoy wearing it!,,,,,,,
I LOVE IT!,,,,,,,
Love it! Easy handling when traveling.,,,,,,,
Excellent product , highly recommended.,,,,,,
This is a nice basic workout t-shirt. It keeps you dry, fit well and is comfortable.,,,,,,
Great fit.,,,,,,,
I didnt like the quality!,,,,,,,
Love this,,,,,,,
Fits comfortably,,,,,,,
Very confortable,,,,,,,
Great top for soccer.,,,,,,,
Ok a bit long...,,,,,,,
Super large neck line,,,,,,,
I bought this shirt thinking the size would run large as thats what many of the reviews said. I did not feel that way about this shirt. I did not like the way it fit me. I am pretty broad and chesty and this shirt was definitely unflattering. It is made for very slim and petite women, not for me. I returned it immediately.,,,,,,
Bought this for my older sister as a christimas present. She loves it so much and commonly gets compliments on it! I plan on getting her a few more next christmas.,,,,,,,
Good as expected.,,,,,,,
Great feeling, rapids drying shirts. Planning a motorcycle trip and taking along a few of these. Rinse out at night and let hand dry.,,,,,,
Great fit, super comfortable, warm, but doesnt make you sweat. Its a perfect workout shirt or great for wearing under a jersey.,,,,
"I enjoy this shirt, as it works for what I intended it for. It was a little bigger than expected, bigger than many other ""Large"" shirts I have but not overly large. Its just a bit loose and a little thin, thats all. Works great though, as I use it as an undershirt in layering for the upper Midwest winters, as it can be quite cold up here. Comfortable, but it should be a bit cheaper, like $20 would be more acceptable. My main gripe is that Nike is really pushing it selling it for about $30 (for just a plain white t-shirt!) just because they can.",,,,,,,
This shirt is very nice, I bought the green one for my husband. The material is thinner but it falls and fits very nice, it does not cling. I highly recommend this shirt.,,,,,
These teet-shirts fit the way I wanted them to, for the size I thought. I have no problem ordering the way I had , thank you.,,,,,
Nice lightweight shirt. Great for working out, or wearing in the sun when you need extra coverage, but want to stay cool.,,,,,
some what too large but good quality sleeves a little too long also good quality so i gave it 3 stars no i would not buy again,,,,,,,
Great training shirt. Dont expect these to keep you warm as they are pretty thin, however they are very nice and soft and looks great. Its a somewhat fitted shirt, so make sure you dont have a tummy or it will show lol.,,,,,
My husband loves this Tee. He washes it in woolite and hang to dry. Last a long time!,,,,,,,
Comfortable, but like any other white workout shirt, will stain with sunscreen.,,,,,
My significant other was very happy with the material of this shirt and it fit perfect,,,,,,,
The sizes run smaller than most, had to return it. Sorry to say they didnt have same in larger sizes.,,,,,,
Excellent quality and price. Fit perfectly. My husband love it.,,,,,,,
Cheap quality with thin material. Not happy with what I got for the price.,,,,,,,
Warm yet cool, looks fresh and feels great. No issues, fits well.,,,,,
Needed a purple shirt. This was a great choice.,,,,,,,
Great Fit! Perfect Wash and Wear!!,,,,,,,
Son loves it. He looks good in it,,,,,,,
Great product, great seller!!!,,,,,,
Im slightly disappointed because the image I viewed appeared that the product faded from a washed out purple to a saturated purple below the shoulders. I referenced the same image while writing this review and have determined that flood lighting is creating a washed out effect on the promotional image. I used the item as a wind breaker over a sweat shirt for a team event that required a purple shirt. I will normally use it as a winter running shirt.,,,,,,,
too big not matter what size,,,,,,,
love the design and fit,,,,,,,
A little bit longer on sleeves than hope for but all in all great!,,,,,,,
nice shirt, comfy and well made,,,,,,
Looks great and fits well,,,,,,,
a gift and was loved,,,,,,,
Another satisfied customer,,,,,,,
Fits great. Extra coverage to keep the sun off during the long runs. Easy clean. Love it!,,,,,,,
Got it for our son-in-law for Christmas - he loved it and has worn it several times!,,,,,,,
Great color and size is a good fit. Happy with purchase.,,,,,,,
Fantastic product. Im absolutely in love with Nike Dri-Fit products,,,,,,,
I got this shirt as a gift for my boyfriend and he really likes it. It fits as expected and he likes that its light on him while he runs. Very timely shipping!,,,,,,,
I purchased one of these in hope of finding something that is light enough to wear and use at the gym, but still thick enough to where my nips wouldnt be popping out the whole time. Im pleased with the buy. The quality is great. Im 511 and weigh about 165-70. I went with a large and am happy i did so. Wear a tank top underneath though. If your gym is cold your nips mighy show.,,,,,,
Very good quality. Great value.,,,,,,,
Fits nice and feels good.,,,,,,,
Comfy,,,,,,,
Excellent product, price and shipping,,,,,,
Fits perfect,,,,,,,
Nice shirt. I have one in gray and now this one in white. I like the fit, i.e., not baggy, and the thinness of the fabric. Other brands are thicker, and I find that makes me too hot while exercising. Also great to wear in the sun.,,,
Bought this for my son and he loves it! Fits as expected!,,,,,,,
This is made in Mexico. The Vietnam fabric is much better.,,,,,,,
I liked this Nike long sleeve a lot.,,,,,,,
Too large,,,,,,,
Great,,,,,,,
I got the large. It looks great, however really is....welll.... quite large. I am 6 feet tall, around 200 pounds with a relatively athletic physique and this is still quite a bit too big on me. Feels more like an extra large. Insanely comfortable though and it still looks great. I would just size down if at all possible.,,,,,
I bought this shirt for longer runs (10+ miles) here in Central Florida on days when it is typically over 90 degrees and over 90% humidity. It definitely makes a difference with the white color as it is highly reflective and keeps you cooler in that regard. Secondly, you are now evaporating sweat from both your skin and the shirt, creating a better core temp cooling mechanism. I recommend.,,,,,
Super super comfortable an awesome looking but the only problem is when you order a large it comes in a slightly smaller size so its not Amazons fault, but rather Nikes for making a shirt and not giving it the proper size but overall still a great purchase and a goal to work towards,,,,,,
The long sleeves feels good but the size are a little bigger then what I ordered. I wear a medium but when I put this on, it feels and look a little bigger then medium but a little smaller then a large.,,,,,,
"Great breathable and ultra-light running shirt! The fit for the M is spot on for someone bw around 510 - 62"", with decent chest room (ie not too snug)",,,,,,,
"Comfortable dry-fit long sleeve t-shirt.
Fits well on medium frame-size.
Made in Jordan.",,,,,,,
great for the gym!,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,
Ive bought several of these. Their great to work out in or to lounge around in.,,,,,,,
bought this for a co-worker for secret santa. bought him a medium but it fits like a large. He still uses it though :) shipped and delivered on time,,,,,,,
"This was ordered for my very thin grandson. He usually wears a mens small, but this was still a bit loose in the small, but he still likes it.
",,,,,,,
100f outside and this long sleeve is keeping me cool, love thus shirt buying more,,,,,,
Fits well like to wear to the gym with my Nike Mens Free Trainer 3.0 V3 Training Shoe [Color: Game Royal/White] its a perfect match. When you running keeps the sweat under control. This way when you leave the gym you arent exposed to the cold air. I have few brands of shirts, but actually find these the most comfortable.,,,,,,
Just as you would expect. But smaller than most. Would get the next size up,,,,,,,
"Nice fit
not see through own two",,,,,,,
shirt feels very good on skin. keeps you cool and fits as expected,,,,,,,
I would recommend. Love the fit and color. No surprises here.,,,,,,,
Very good shirt made with nice expensive looking material. The shirt fits very well. I purchased the purple because most of the other colors were sold out in large. I was skeptical of the color because its purple. However, the shirt looks really good on.,,,,,,
Bought it for a Christmas gift & they loved it,,,,,,,
great shirt - fits accordingly and looks great - highly recommend,,,,,,,
"I ordered size M, its a little tight around chest, sending it back.

The material is dri-fit, very thin, but durable, not too bad for $32 I paid.",,,,,,,
A little oversized, decent quality.,,,,,,
I love this ! I would buy more!,,,,,,,
Nice color and fit,,,,,,,
Came in as red and not maroon my boyfriend ended up keeping it but now he has two of the same color,,,,,,,
Dont typically buy clothing from Amazon, but my husband has a NIKE Black long sleeve crew and wanted a white one. The size is accurate.,,,,,,
The outside tag said Large but when tried on realized it was very tight. The inside tag showed it was a small.,,,,,,,
exelent,,,,,,,
some of these run so small like they are meant for undershirts or workout only but this is a good shirt for relaxing or casual wear no form fitting,,,,,,,
I bought this lightweight dry fit for my husband to wear to the gym. He loves it. It provides extra warmth under his t shirt because our gym is always freezing cold. I bought a medium, he weighs about 165 and is 5 10 and it fits true to size.,,,,,,
great!!!,,,,,,,
Got for my father-in-law for Christmas, who usually wears a Tall, and it fit very well. He loved it so much he wore it two days in a row! LOL!,,,,,
Nice Shirt.,,,,,,,
Great fit and quality, exactly what I needed,,,,,,
Fits well throughout chest and back etc. Was expecting more of a tight fit through the arms however and wrists, however. All in all a great shirt though.,,,,,,
Great purchase. Im 62 200 pounds and ordered a large. The shirt fits great and came MUCH faster than the ETA,,,,,,,
The upper part of the sleeves are oddly baggy, while the lower forearm fits as expected. My husband isnt really a fan of it, but I think I will try to alter it so the upper arms fit more like they should.,,,,,
Great shirt for the price....Very comfortable!,,,,,,,
I was very disappointed. It was thinner and more see-through than the picture depicted. I will just use it as an undershirt on a cold day.,,,,,,,
Arrived on time and looks okay - not really impressed with the material and it had a weird smell to it when it first arrived.,,,,,,,
you can buy it at the same price outside.,,,,,,,
I bought two of these and love them. Loose fitting and lightweight. Perfect for working, hiking/camping, or just lounging around the house.,,,,,
Fits beautifully,,,,,,,
Love this shirt. Excellent for working out in or just casual wear.,,,,,,,
I have three of these all different colors. Ordered them from the same place. Fast shipping! Will buy a few more in different colors soon.,,,,,,,
"A gift for my hubby, He is 511"" 173lbs, I got him size L. It fits well.",,,,,,,
Bought it for my husband, looks And fits great,,,,,,
It was perfect just what my grandson wanted. The fit was just right, the purple was a beautiful color. Very pleased.,,,,,,
Perfect fit, great for running.,,,,,,
For some reason this fabric snags very easily on velcro. (the hook side). I have a dozen of these NikeFit that I bought years ago that dont do that.,,,,,,,
Bit larger than description.,,,,,,,
These are sized a little bigger than you would think or are used too. But the quality is still the NIKE quality. I would easy buy again.,,,,,,,
An excellent & interesting transaction,,,,,,,
Dri-Fit T-shirts are a great idea. I wear it when I play tennis in the sun to keep the sun off of my arms. It is great!,,,,,,,
I really love this as a long sleeve under shirt, under my golf polo shirts. Or can be worn as an outer shirt, its not very heavy, very light breathable material,,,,
"Great fit , exactly as described, fast delivery
I would order from this seller again",,,,,,,
My husband loves these shirts for running in the winter. Bought as a Christmas present.,,,,,,,
"I bought this t-shirt for my daughters boy friend he loved it.
Beautiful blue",,,,,,,
My husband really likes these shirts and this one is one of his favorites. Its thin enough to wear underneath a sweatshirt/fleece or to layer over a tshirt. Dri-fit material.,,,,,,,
It is great and my nephew loved it, the material was comfortable and the fit was good,,,,,,
Bought as a gift for my brother - he loves it! Stated is was comfortable and washed great. He is tall and has broad shoulders - fit great all the way around.,,,,,,,
Perfect shirt if you are running outdoors in the winter or late fall. It fits loose and is very comfortable! I would definitely reccommend this product.,,,,,,,
Great shirt, cool, nice material. Fits a littler big but is great for exercising when it is not that hot out.,,,,,
I rock one of these in a different color at least 5 days a week. Theyre legit af,,,,,,,
Arms are a bit tight where they attach to the body. Otherwise fits as expected.,,,,,,,
All perfect, thanks!!!!,,,,,,
Was not what i expected, please be careful of what the item description says and what your expectations are.,,,,,,
??,,,,,,,
Slow ship but worth the wait.,,,,,,,
I am somewhat dissapointed with how dark the color of the shirt is .,,,,,,,
Great long sleeve running shirt. Ive owned these before so no big surprise.,,,,,,,
Nike is still the best dry fit weave available, Ive bought adidas and others but they can be scratchy.,,,,,,
This shirt will get you hella chicks,,,,,,,
Too thin !Long sleeves!,,,,,,,
Fits perfectly and material is light for late spring/early fall weather in the mid-west.,,,,,,,
You get what you pay for. Very thin, badly fitting shirt,,,,,,
Fits good, but this is way light weight. In fact you can see right thought this shirt? For the price I thought it would be higher quality Nike.,,,,,,
Nice quality and good finishing as well. If you have an athletic body type this would look perfect. I use these for gym and dont feel sweaty.,,,,,,,
Bought a medium; small would probably be the right fit,,,,,,,
Fits just as expected. Im very happy with my purchase,,,,,,,
Great color,though i wish the swoosh was embroidered..,,,,,,
Ive bought several of these & they are a good look & so comfortable!,,,,,,,
"It isnt made of the same material as the ""Nike Dri-fit"". The item is also too small.
Not happy with this purchase.",,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
I was skeptical, but believe all the other reviewers now- this runs really a size or size and a half big. I usually wear a L, but this was the biggest, longest M Ive ever seen!,,,,
Fits perfectly. Feels great in the heat considering I walk all day as a letter carrier.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt, fits very good. Like the fabric. Will be good sun protection without being too hot.,,,,,,
I like the color, the fit, the weight (perfect for coolish summer days).,,,,,
Loved it!,,,,,,,
Awesome shirt and fits as expected..,,,,,,,
Loose sleeves exactly what I wanted for bug protection.,,,,,,,
Fits slightly bigger than expected, but great product. Exactly what I was looking for!,,,,,,
Light and dry feel.,,,,,,,
My husband likes this shirt a lot,,,,,,,
The material is strange. Tends to hold body odor and doesnt breathe well. Not liking it so far,,,,,,,
Grandson was very proud of it.,,,,,,,
great fit, just what i wanted,,,,,,
very nice fit true to sizing,,,,,,,
Shirt fits loosely, but is true to size.,,,,,,
Shirt was the perfect gift.,,,,,,,
Good shirt but doesnt fit as expected.,,,,,,,

Bought this as a gift for a friend at the gym. He loved it and it fits him great.,,,,,,,

A little big in the arms. My boyfriend loves it and its great quality,,,,,,,
A little tight but perfect for an under layer.,,,,,,,

Very good Dri-Fit long sleeve shirt for running in cool weather.,,,,,,,
Absolutely Perfect!!,,,,,,,
Good quality...good fit.....nice material for a trip as it is easy to clean,,,,,,,
great shirt, very comfortable and form fitting,,,,,,
These shirts are great for working out. Keeps you dry and very comfortable. I have used them for hiking in cold weather as well as an undershirt to wick sweat away.,,,,,,,
Item as described,,,,,,,
Awesome like all things Nike. The only thing is the neck line runs a little loose for my liking. A thicker seam on the neckline would make this shirt perfect.,,,,,,,
Shirt fit as expected and was the exact shade of red I wanted.,,,,,,,
Fits well, easy to wrestle in and work out in,,,,,,
fits great,,,,,,,
Great,,,,,,,

The shirt was a gift for my boyfriend. It was packaged well, and still had the tags. It fit him a little big,,,,,,
perfect,,,,,,,
Great,,,,,,,
Great shirt!,,,,,,,
Nice fit, thanks,,,,,,
Good fits,,,,,,,
Love it!,,,,,,,
Excelent,,,,,,,
#swag,,,,,,,
good for price,,,,,,,
It fit well.,,,,,,,
Fast shipping. Exactly what i wanted,,,,,,,
Shirt fits very well, is very soft and comfortable. I ordered a few more in other colors. Good for exercising.,,,,,,
as expected,,,,,,,
fits great,,,,,,,
Ordered a size small...it was huge...and I am 5.10 and 150 LBs...,,,,,,,
Love these Nike Dri-Fit crew tops. Long sleeve or short sleeve they make for great casual shirts or workout shirts. Theyre breathable, durable, and fashionable. The heather grey color is my favorite. I bought this one to replace the one I let my friend borrow(which he has yet to return). Great product!,,,,,
My son wanted to purchase this. While I felt it was a bit overpriced, he was very happy with it. The material is very breathable.,,,,,,
Bought it for my husband. He loves these dry-fit tees and wanted this color. He was somewhat disappointed because it fit him larger than the other long sleeve dry-fit Nike tees that he has bought in the past. For future buyers, I recommend buying a size smaller.,,,,,,
Fit perfect - large as expected. Great material that dries quick.,,,,,,,
is bad,,,,,,,
I use this for golf when I go to practice and occasionally play. Feels great in Texas summers at 100+ degree heat. Usually a concern for me is how see threw the white is but I have not had that problem with this product! Am going to buy more and get a polo version as well,,,,,,,
This is a nice product, but the arms are very long compared with the body. If you need a shirt for a bigger body, but dont have particularly long arms, you may want to look at other similar products.,,,,
It doesnt feel like a Nike product. Looks like a cheap rip off.,,,,,,,
Solid shirt. I got this item for the gym but I also wear it when Im not in the gym. It is light so it is very breathable. I have a few short sleeve versions of this shirt but I think Ill be getting more of these in the future.,,,,,,,
"Really like the shirt but it definitely runs large. I am 62"" and the sleeves are long and the neck opening is larger than I would like. Really wish I had ordered a size smaller but stuck with an expensive t-shirt.",,,,,,,
Fit perfectly,,,,,,,
Very nice fit, color very true to picture and size was very accurate, my husband loved it,,,,,
The only problem I have is that I paid 30 dollars for a 28 dollar shirt. Thats what it said on the tag !! I should have looked further for a better deal !!,,,,,,,
I would advise anyone purchasing to order a size down. I ordered a medium and it looks like a large plus its a very loose material so that makes it even bigger fitting.,,,,,,,
My husband really likes this shirt however it swallows him. And the sleeves are long. Still giving 4 stars because for someone that it fits it would be perfect.,,,,,,,
This is a nice shirt for working out or casual wear. It is really thin material so can be worn in summer too. It fits nice, not super tight but like a t-shirt.,,,,,,
The shirt arrived quickly, and his extremely comfortable. I recommend this product for anyone that is interested in being comfortable while working out.,,,,,,
Everything arrived on time and in good condition. Great product for working out - exactly what I was hoping for / expected. Happy with my purchase,,,,,,,
He said its light weight very comfortable. As for me the wash, Can wear right out of dryer and its looks brand new. I bought all colors for him.,,,,,,
"The material is cheap. Not what I expected from reading the reviews. Ive bought actual Nike ""dri-fit"" from Nike and those were actually very durable and warm. This material is very thin. If you want it just for looks for the gym, I guess its ok but for its purpose -dont buy",,,,,,,
It doesnt seem authentic. It was huge. Small fit like a large. Material isnt similar to Nikes shirts.,,,,,,,
To large for me,,,,,,,
I ordered an XL and I received an XL Tall. Does not fit well at all. Product is not as described.,,,,,,,
Great it is exactly what I ordered.....great product and great price, would order more of these in the future for sure,,,,,,
The shirt was a little too big but I still use it. It works great and worth the price I paid.,,,,,,,
Excellent quality. My grandson loved it and it looked great on him. Very pleased.,,,,,,,
S Size was a bit large and wide for me in the sleeves, but still being a good product!,,,,,,
this product is very good, apart from their arrival shipping services consider them the best,,,,,,
Good fit and so far good quality to resistance to wear and tear,,,,,,,
No comment,,,,,,,
Nice Long Sleeve!,,,,,,,
great product snd customer service,,,,,,,
Its ok,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
Dont buy it. When i saw this first time in my eyes, i couldnt believe my eyes. I ordered T-shirt not dress. So I measured this stupid long bodied T-shirt, it was 29.5 inches. How can man have a body lengths of 29.5 inches? Besides the fact that i am Asian, this T-shirt is way too long.,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
I was expecting more of an under armor type of shirt. you know, tightly fit on the sleeves to show off biceps.? A bit loose on the arms and short in length of the entire shirt. fits kind of awkward for my taste. Good material though.,,,,,,
I hate the fit as that the large fits like a normal x-large. Something was wrong with the sizing.,,,,,,,
About 100% sure this shirt isnt a real Nike Dri-Fit. I own about 4 different Dri-fits and this one is counterfeit. The Nike swoosh looks and feels fake, the fabric doesnt feel like a Dri fit.,,,,,,
Excelente. Continuaré comprando a este vendedor. Tienda recomendada para hacer más compras internacionales. GRACIAS POR LA VENTA DEL PRODUCTO. SALUDOS,,,,,,,
Comfy sweater especially for work in the spring and fall,,,,,,,
I initially ordered a couple of these Nike long sleeve shirts in a couple of colors to check out the quality of the material and the workmanship. Some people had posted that the shirts were too sheer and too light for their use. All I can say is that these shirts are my new faves for working out and for wearing under quarter zip pullover shirts. I think I have ordered a total of six or seven of these shirts in various colors and I was actually contemplating ordering a few more when amazon sent an email message asking me to post a review on these shirts. The shirts are generously sized. The material is high quality and is very comfortable next to my skin, unlike some of my other long sleeve work out shirts. The workmanship is excellent. They come in a wide variety of colors. And, they are only +/- $25.00 each. Believe me, you will not be disappointed. These shirts are a great value. Enjoy... and just do it !!,,,,
This dri fit shirt is made of very very thin/fine fabric. It completely takes to the shape of your body. So unless youve got a banging body this might not be the shirt for you. The other dri fit materials are made of a hardier fabric that can kind of keep their shape. I didnt like this one because of the fit. But if youre a runner looking for a next to naked feeling dri fit shirt, this might be the shirt for you.,,,,,,
Nice shirt. I normally wear an x-lg t-shirt, so I got this in an x-lg as well, but I wish I had opted for a large. This kind of shirt wasnt meant to be this loose. My fault, though, so Im still giving it 5-stars. I guess Ill get another, but in large, and Ill just wear this one while doing yard-work or something. Id recommend you guys to consider getting a size smaller than usual.,
"Found my new favorite shirt(s) can wear it for a run or out to eat and very comfortable. Fits good 5""10 165 lbs size large (maybe a tad loose but not bad) very thin though. Nike makes a version 2.0 to this shirt that has some cotton rather than 100% poly that I like better but still love this shirt.",,,,,,,
"really low quality material for this shirt I was expecting something way better for the price and the Nike brand although Im doubting if its actually legit. The Nike logo isnt reflective neither the ""Dri-Fit"" something I found weird because if you look closely to the other shirts they say NikeFit. My chest is quite visble with this tshirt something that Im not a fan though and I used and sweated it and it doesnt dry as my other Nike or whatever other sport brand tshirt. Sadly Im not in the US otherwise Id ask for a refund.

This review isnt biased. Nobody is paying to talk about the crappy product I bought is just a customers opinion about a con over a ""Nike"" shirt. Sad

Here are some pictures of the product.",,,,,,,
"I bought this shirt b/c I wanted a long sleeve shirt to wear around the house that wasnt too warm. This works perfectly. Its light, cool, and extremely comfortable.

Regarding the size, Im 60 and weight 230. I tend to buy XXL size shirts, but on the suggestion of other reviews, I ordered an XL. The fit is perfect, which is to say that any purchasers should also consider ordering a size smaller than normal.",,,,,,,
"The fabric is thin but nice, its overall a good looking shirt, but I have to return it since it was far too large. I normally order medium (I am 5 10.5), but I ordered small (which is the smallest size available) based on the reviews. Both the shirt and the sleeves are about 1 longer than the maximum that I would tolerate. There is also a lot of extra fabric under the armpits and the shirt fits pretty loosely, so I would just order 1-2 sizes smaller if that was possible. The shirt label says ""S"", so I was sent the correct size.",,,,,,,
Very cheap shirt, not like the photo what so ever. Im not sure why so much good reviews but its the only reason I thought i was getting a nice shirt which is cheap looking shirt, the only reason for the two starts is the super fast shipping!! Not worth the money! Believe me....,,,,,
"Great shirt. Love the material and feel. I usually get a large, but purchased med because of reviews. Fits good but I like shirts to be a little more loose. Going to order a couple more but large this time. Im 510, 180.

11-16-15 I ordered 2 more. I am LE and wear under my uniform. Hold up well and very comfortable.",,,,,,,
"I bought these shirts in 2014 and my initial response to these shirts was they were fantastic. All the seams l lie flat inside and out. Fit was good felt great on so long as I only wore them short term. So for fit and quality of manufacture they would get 5 stars, but this is 2016 and I believe there are some other considerations and technologies that should be added to this type of shirt. I used these shirts as I worked maintenance for a condo and later as a pest control technician.

Having anti-odor/Anti-microbial technology made into the shirt didnt seem that important when I bought these items. However, it has to be if you need to wear a shirt made with this type of fabric longer than a few hours. When I wore these shirts under my short sleeve work shirt they became foul smelling on long hot days. I thought it might be me forgetting deodorant or something, I even carried a spare stick in my truck. After I switched to another brand with anti-odor/Anti-microbial properties I didnt have the odor issues I had with the Nike Dry Fit. So this consideration is rated by me a critical fail.

Additionally these are not advertised as having any sun protection capability, another component I need here in NW Florida. I now wear this type of shirt to play tennis to try to stay cool in the summer and get some protection from the sun to make my dermatologist happy. I want to avoid sunscreen so it doesnt mess up my grip on the racquet. After wearing these shirts for nearly a year my dermatologist treated and area in the middle of my back. Hence my renewed interest in UPF shirts. Again this area is rated by me as a critical fail.

Bottom Line: Just dont, I have to replace these Nike Dry Fit shirts to get the anti-odor/Anti-microbial and UPF 50 capabilities available in other shirts so I wasted my money on Nike. Im trying the Vapor Apparel Mens UPF Long Sleeve Solar Performance T-Shirt as a replacement.",,,,,,,
The Nike Mens Legend Poly Long Sleeve Dri-Fit T-shirt arrived within the scheduled time frame and was exactly as described on the site. It fits well, is very comfortable and I would recommend it to anyone that either works out or, wants to wear it as a long sleeved shirt under a short sleeved shirt.,,,,,
The sleeves are so long. Im 60. 165lbs. I wear an XL. The sleeves hang past my hands about 3-4 inches.,,,,,,,
"I bought this shirt from another site since it was a lot cheaper.

The shirt definitely runs large. Im 510"", 170 lbs, and usually wear mediums for Nike shirts, and they arent too loose on me. I bought a small of this shirt and it fits me very well, you could maybe even say its a little baggy, which is fine with me.

The shirt is thin, made to wear in the summer or for workouts, not the best to keep warm.

However, the shirt is very comfortable and its not too thin that you can see through it.",,,,,,,
This is a nice quality shirt, especially if you order the right size. I ordered it for my husband who is small in stature. He is 5ft. 7 and 150 pounds. I ordered a medium and it fits him very well. He loved the shirt so much that I ordered another one in Maroon. Unfortunately, they sent me the red which is why I only gave four stars as opposed to five. The only reason why I didnt send it back is because my husband decided to go ahead and keep the red even though that is not the color I wanted.,,,,,
Very nice fit and feel.Well made. Its a kind of a semi-mesh fabric that looks to be breathable. Would buy another one anytime soon. Im pleased with my purchase.,,,,,,,
"The picture of the product shows a Nike check.
Be aware the shirt may not have a Nike check.
As seen below, mine did not.",,,,,,,
"PRICED ABOVE MSRP. First thing first. These are Overpriced. This particular Nike Dri-Fit Training shirt has an MSRP of $22 (see picture of the tag from the green shirt for $22 and I paid $24 for it) and most of them listed here are going for $22-$30. That is ridiculous. You can go to Dicks Sporting Goods website and get them for $16.50. I ordered two of these shirts in red and green size XL for $23 and $24 respectively. The only reason I ordered these is because I thought they were the Dri-Fit Ts that normally retail for ~$35 and I thought I was getting a good deal. I have two of the $35 dri-fit t-shirts already, which fit really nice (not tight, I hate tight shirts, but not loose). These cheaper dri-fit t-shirts fit much larger than the $35 ones (see picture red $22 MSRP from amazon on left and navy $35 MSRP from Dicks on right, both XL). I am 63"", 230 lbs and the XL feels like I am wearing a dress.

I will be returning these shirts. I paid too much for what they actually are, and on top of that the fit is a little on the large size. There is no problem with the shirts quality wise, besides the larger fit. But if you do want one of these, do yourself a favor and dont order from here. Order it from Dicks for $16.50.",,,,,,,
"Fantastic product, the high quality stuff you expect from Nike.

Fits a tad large, but this is a performance shirt, so the idea behind it is to remove swear from the body and dry out. Dont expect this to hug at all, its meant to be a tad loose.

Awesome for warmer climates and situations where you gotta sweat but stay cool!",,,,,,,
Nice, comfortable shirt. I wear it playing tennis, jogging, boating, or just out running errands. It does seem to run a bit large, and long, but not so bad that I dont like it. I have several colors, and it is odd that they have such a wide range of prices. White was cheapest.
Im such a big fan of this running and workout shirt. It wicks moisture very well. I actually use it for hiking to keep my body cool, especially as a base layer during the spring or early fall.,,,,,,
The Nike Mens Legend shirt fit great for my son. He used it at summer camp as he was part of the purple cabin. He wore the shirt for all types of activities including game time, lunch/dinner, free time and various sporting events. The shirt did a great job wicking moisture away from his body and provided great protection from the elements. I would recommend this shirt as a great outdoor/indoor activity shirt.,,,,,
Nice fit and wears as advertised. Dri material retains slight smell after a few wears and washes. Does seem to go away after a deep soak and cleanse.,,,,,,,
Awesome and comfortable shirt! I wear when working out, playing tennis, and just around the house. Good price as well!,,,,,
This particular shirt came quite a bit larger than my other Medium Nike Dri-Fits. I noticed they were all made in different countries, so that might be the issue. Ill try and buy these shirts from local stores to make sure its the nice tight fit I was hoping for.,,,,,,
"Not yellow
It is a puke color and it was wadded up in the package
Don’t think it’s original nike",,,,,,,
Definitely great and authentic Nike quality, but a bit too large. Ordered a 2x, and its seriously huge.,,,,,
Quality is good but its extremely LARGE. Im 60 220pounds and the size large was dancing over my body,,,,,,,
Comfortable and fits well. I bought it late spring and have only worn it for a short run, but it breathed well. Would highly recommend it.,,,,,,
Purchased them for my daughter in law and she loves them. Very well made.,,,,,,,
fav longsleeve to work out it. i got the red/burgandy and always get compliments on the color,,,,,,,
Perfect Shirt, I love the high quality and it is very comfortable and light for the summer! I gave 4 stars because is a little large for me.,,,,,,
Great sports gear and my daughter loves them.,,,,,,,
It is an excellent product,,,,,,,
PERFECT ORANGE & FITS GREAT!,,,,,,,
Great looking casual shirt,,,,,,,
Very nice warm weather top for active sports.,,,,,,,
very thin fabric,,,,,,,
As noted, fit the person it was for great.,,,,,,
nice,,,,,,,
Just received the shirts and they fit as expected. Im very happy.,,,,,,,
XS is good fit but sleeves were too tight.,,,,,,,
I got this shirt today and I made the mistake to go by the size chart! Im 5ft 137lbs and according to the chart Im large but is way-way too big on me, Im returning this item.,,,,,,
I didnt realize this shirt was sheer. Super disappointed. I thought Id be able to wear it out for running errands & working out, but now I have to send it back.,,,,,,
Itchy... material not soft.,,,,,,,
Perfect for what I needed,,,,,,,
Cotton material, NOT dri-fit material. Not tight and I got an XS. Still a cute shirt but,,,,,,
Perfect,,,,,,,
I ordered a extra Large like all my others. This seems to run way small. Order up a size or two.,,,,,,,
I wear this every Monday Wednesday and Friday when I work on my upper body, it feels great! I love how it feels, I dont feel all nasty and wet and feel like my clothes is sticking to my body after Im done with my work out, not tight nice and loose, some people might not like it like that but I do, I recommend if you want it a little tight then get a size lower, I got the size I wear on my regular shirts and it was a little big but I like it like that.,
My husband loves these shirts!,,,,,,,
"The fit is good and I think for most people these would be perfect. I find I am always between sizes and this is no exception. My shoulders stick out a bit more than I would desire and the neck and arm holes are snug. I am 6 and weigh 175 43"" chest, 33"" waist so finding clothes is hard for me. Nonetheless these are high quality shirts that I will happily wear. They are a bit pricey for a sleeveless tee but they are Nike.",,,,,,,
"Fit was great, love the color, husband liked the ""muscle t"" look with the wider tank straps.",,,,,,,
super comfortable shirt,,,,,,,
Fits well and feels good,,,,,,,
Great shirt,,,,,,,
The shirt is fine but I got a medium and it is a little large. If you like your workout shirts a little looser than this is a good choice.,,,,,,,
I am very disappointed by the quality of this T shirt. It has a low quality material and does not compare to other Nike Dri-Fit clothing which we have bought in the past. After washing it once following the instructions it came out of the washer all fluffy with lots of lints on it (see the attached photo). I would not recommend buying it if you are looking for a good quality Dri-Fit T.,,,,,,,

This fits differently than my original Dri-Fit shirt, which I love. The shoulders are smaller, the material is different and a lighter weight (a little bit of see-through), and the torso is blousier. If you have broad or muscley shoulders, it will feel a bit tight. Overall weird fit for me.,,,
Seems to be cheaper material than Nikes other dry-fit shirts. A little long and loose around the waist, but I prefer that over being tight.,,,,,,
Will defiantly be replacing all my casual shirts with these in every color. Very nice material breaths well without being see through. Streatchy so very comfortable and perfect for outdoor activities and exercising drys quick exactly what it was supposed to do!,,,,,,,
I am a plus size after having a baby. I read the reviews of all those who said it ran large. I usually size up when buying online but due to those reviews I bought my usual size. This thing does not run big..,,,,,,,
The image is of a sports bra rather than of the black shirt I got for workouts.,,,,,,,
Fit really small but love the feel of the material wish it wouldve fit right,,,,,,,
"Great shirt for the gym. The M fit is somewhat loose, which I expected for the style.

Two stars because this shirt retails at $24.99 on the tag. Theyre selling at a premium.

My advice, wait until the price drops to at least $20 to get a better deal or run out to the nearest sporting goods store and buy one on sale at a retail store.",,,,,,,
I dont like to wear tight clothing when I run, but this was too big.,,,,,,
Excellent fit and the material dries fast. Great value and great design for workout or even casual wear.,,,,,,,
1.5 sizes too big but wearable. If wear a medium maybe opt for a small.,,,,,,,
Fit well and tighter than the Nike Womens Miler Short sleeve top,,,,,,,
Love this, its light weight and not clingy. I will be ordering again...,,,,,,
Comfy, however, little thick (warm) for summers,,,,,
This is more see through than the old dri-fit shirts. Its also on the large side. Im usually between a small and medium and I got the small but it was still a bit large after a few rounds in the dryer on high. Pretty color though and seems like its made well.,,,,,,,
"i dont know what happened but I bought 2 dry-fit T shirts size L (I have one M and it is a little tight thats why I bought L), but what I received wasnt what I expected. I had to give them to my husband and they fit them ok.
I am in argentina so I cant sned them back.
It was a waste of money.",,,,,,,
Niceeee nicceeee shirt,,,,,,,
Love Nike gear,,,,,,,
good quality,,,,,,,
Good shirt!,,,,,,,
Not even the same shirt that was shown! The purple is actually a dark pinkish color not a deep purple like what is in the images and description. It doesnt have the nike logo on the front and it has mesh on the back and sides. Not at all what was shown in the pictures.,,,,,,,
The color. Was not what the web site showed.,,,,,,,
Great Shirt,,,,,,,
Arrived quickly and great price!,,,,,,,
Ordered the Royal blue . Its much much brighter than the picture. Also ordered an XS and is still too big. Cannot wear it for this race.,,,,,,,
Nice color,,,,,,,
Nice color - if you are looking for a fitted look this is not the shirt - I wear a medium and its a little big - but the small would have been to small,,,,,,,
Wonderful shirt! Looks great and feels better. My daughter typically wears a womens small to med.so we hot small and its still loose,,,,,,,
Love this shirt!! I use it for my gym workouts, very comfortable and goes with everything.,,,,,,
Nice fit and very light,,,,,,,
It was larger than I expected. I should have ordered a small one for next time. But overall its comfortable for workout so Im happy with it.,,,,,,,
I received this shirt the day after I ordered it! And then ordered it in another color because of how perfect it is,,,,,,,
I love this material. When I work out and wear this shirt I dont feel like it weighs me down when I sweat,,,,,,,
Nothing like last years Legend Tee which fit better and I liked the material better.,,,,,,,
Great condition,,,,,,,
Fits great, nice material!,,,,,,
Its bit large but I like that for my jiu jitsu class.. Good buy and fast delivery,,,,,,,
very bad quality......the logo not white,its gray logo......its exist in local market by 3 usd,,,,,,
You can find a better product fot that price, too expensive and not that great,,,,,,
Very nice,,,,,,,
Excellent fit! Quality fabric. Love the color. Holds up to frequent washing and drying. Couldnt be happier.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt!,,,,,,,
Perfect cut. Not too tight but has a feminine, not boxy, cut. Love it.,,,,,
Color is not as shown, fit is loose.,,,,,,
Wish it was just a bit bigger in width. But it is just what I wanted for looks. Very comfortable. I have washed it and it did not shrink.,,,,,,,
Perfect, it was a gift, She loved it,,,,,
Color is it even close to what is pictured. Its is not a bright gold/yellow.. its a dull tan/pale gold color,,,,,,,
This shirt is the only shirt I use for exercising. I have five of them and love them. The fit is perfect.,,,,,,,
perfect fit,,,,,,,
It wasnt as nice as the one with the same name (DriFit) purchased in a store; its a very thin material.,,,,,,,
Clearly not a real small!,,,,,,,
Great fit, true to size,,,,,,
arrived in time for Christmas. Fit perfectly.,,,,,,,
Arrived on time and exactly as described.,,,,,,,
Thinner than some of my other Nike tops but a good length. I would buy again!,,,,,,,
Fits my wife perfectly. Looks great and keeps you cool on hot days!,,,,,,,
Grandaughter loves it !,,,,,,,
Great length and light weight. True to color,,,,,,,
The fit was as expected. Im very happy with this shirt. Its soft, thick enough to not see through and long enough so I can go through airport security and raise my arms without showing my stomach. I love it,,,,,,
Great t-shirt but runs small. Very fit cut,,,,,,,
good, but I had a mistake when I choose the size, it is too long, it covered my hip,,,,
This is not yellow. It is beige. I like the shirt but dont order unless you want beige.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt feels great,,,,,,,
Love it,,,,,,,
Runs a tiny bit large but fast shipping and exactly what I was looking for,,,,,,,
Runs long, but happy to have senior rear covered.,,,,,,
Fitted as expected! Keeps me cool during a workout,,,,,,,
What i wanted,,,,,,,
Love it,,,,,,,
"i hate this shirt. it is NOT like my other Nike crew neck dry fit shirt.
they obviously discountinued the one i like because i cant find it anywhere.
this is not a fitted shirt. i wear a small( in a fitted shirt) this one fits baggy and loose and long.",,,,,,,
Great material and comfort,,,,,,,
ok,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,
Love it!!,,,,,,,
Very cool garment; will enjoy wearing it!,,,,,,,
I LOVE IT!,,,,,,,
Love it! Easy handling when traveling.,,,,,,,
Excellent product , highly recommended.,,,,,,
This is a nice basic workout t-shirt. It keeps you dry, fit well and is comfortable.,,,,,,
Great fit.,,,,,,,
I didnt like the quality!,,,,,,,
Love this,,,,,,,
Fits comfortably,,,,,,,
Very confortable,,,,,,,
Great top for soccer.,,,,,,,
Ok a bit long...,,,,,,,
Super large neck line,,,,,,,
I bought this shirt thinking the size would run large as thats what many of the reviews said. I did not feel that way about this shirt. I did not like the way it fit me. I am pretty broad and chesty and this shirt was definitely unflattering. It is made for very slim and petite women, not for me. I returned it immediately.,,,,,,
Bought this for my older sister as a christimas present. She loves it so much and commonly gets compliments on it! I plan on getting her a few more next christmas.,,,,,,,
Good as expected.,,,,,,,
Great feeling, rapids drying shirts. Planning a motorcycle trip and taking along a few of these. Rinse out at night and let hand dry.,,,,,,
Great fit, super comfortable, warm, but doesnt make you sweat. Its a perfect workout shirt or great for wearing under a jersey.,,,,
"I enjoy this shirt, as it works for what I intended it for. It was a little bigger than expected, bigger than many other ""Large"" shirts I have but not overly large. Its just a bit loose and a little thin, thats all. Works great though, as I use it as an undershirt in layering for the upper Midwest winters, as it can be quite cold up here. Comfortable, but it should be a bit cheaper, like $20 would be more acceptable. My main gripe is that Nike is really pushing it selling it for about $30 (for just a plain white t-shirt!) just because they can.",,,,,,,
This shirt is very nice, I bought the green one for my husband. The material is thinner but it falls and fits very nice, it does not cling. I highly recommend this shirt.,,,,,
These teet-shirts fit the way I wanted them to, for the size I thought. I have no problem ordering the way I had , thank you.,,,,,
Nice lightweight shirt. Great for working out, or wearing in the sun when you need extra coverage, but want to stay cool.,,,,,
some what too large but good quality sleeves a little too long also good quality so i gave it 3 stars no i would not buy again,,,,,,,
Great training shirt. Dont expect these to keep you warm as they are pretty thin, however they are very nice and soft and looks great. Its a somewhat fitted shirt, so make sure you dont have a tummy or it will show lol.,,,,,
My husband loves this Tee. He washes it in woolite and hang to dry. Last a long time!,,,,,,,
Comfortable, but like any other white workout shirt, will stain with sunscreen.,,,,,
My significant other was very happy with the material of this shirt and it fit perfect,,,,,,,
The sizes run smaller than most, had to return it. Sorry to say they didnt have same in larger sizes.,,,,,,
Excellent quality and price. Fit perfectly. My husband love it.,,,,,,,
Cheap quality with thin material. Not happy with what I got for the price.,,,,,,,
Warm yet cool, looks fresh and feels great. No issues, fits well.,,,,,
Needed a purple shirt. This was a great choice.,,,,,,,
Great Fit! Perfect Wash and Wear!!,,,,,,,
Son loves it. He looks good in it,,,,,,,
Great product, great seller!!!,,,,,,
Im slightly disappointed because the image I viewed appeared that the product faded from a washed out purple to a saturated purple below the shoulders. I referenced the same image while writing this review and have determined that flood lighting is creating a washed out effect on the promotional image. I used the item as a wind breaker over a sweat shirt for a team event that required a purple shirt. I will normally use it as a winter running shirt.,,,,,,,
too big not matter what size,,,,,,,
love the design and fit,,,,,,,
A little bit longer on sleeves than hope for but all in all great!,,,,,,,
nice shirt, comfy and well made,,,,,,
Looks great and fits well,,,,,,,
a gift and was loved,,,,,,,
Another satisfied customer,,,,,,,
Fits great. Extra coverage to keep the sun off during the long runs. Easy clean. Love it!,,,,,,,
Got it for our son-in-law for Christmas - he loved it and has worn it several times!,,,,,,,
Great color and size is a good fit. Happy with purchase.,,,,,,,
Fantastic product. Im absolutely in love with Nike Dri-Fit products,,,,,,,
I got this shirt as a gift for my boyfriend and he really likes it. It fits as expected and he likes that its light on him while he runs. Very timely shipping!,,,,,,,
I purchased one of these in hope of finding something that is light enough to wear and use at the gym, but still thick enough to where my nips wouldnt be popping out the whole time. Im pleased with the buy. The quality is great. Im 511 and weigh about 165-70. I went with a large and am happy i did so. Wear a tank top underneath though. If your gym is cold your nips mighy show.,,,,,,
Very good quality. Great value.,,,,,,,
Fits nice and feels good.,,,,,,,
Comfy,,,,,,,
Excellent product, price and shipping,,,,,,
Fits perfect,,,,,,,
Nice shirt. I have one in gray and now this one in white. I like the fit, i.e., not baggy, and the thinness of the fabric. Other brands are thicker, and I find that makes me too hot while exercising. Also great to wear in the sun.,,,
Bought this for my son and he loves it! Fits as expected!,,,,,,,
This is made in Mexico. The Vietnam fabric is much better.,,,,,,,
I liked this Nike long sleeve a lot.,,,,,,,
Too large,,,,,,,
Great,,,,,,,
I got the large. It looks great, however really is....welll.... quite large. I am 6 feet tall, around 200 pounds with a relatively athletic physique and this is still quite a bit too big on me. Feels more like an extra large. Insanely comfortable though and it still looks great. I would just size down if at all possible.,,,,,
I bought this shirt for longer runs (10+ miles) here in Central Florida on days when it is typically over 90 degrees and over 90% humidity. It definitely makes a difference with the white color as it is highly reflective and keeps you cooler in that regard. Secondly, you are now evaporating sweat from both your skin and the shirt, creating a better core temp cooling mechanism. I recommend.,,,,,
Super super comfortable an awesome looking but the only problem is when you order a large it comes in a slightly smaller size so its not Amazons fault, but rather Nikes for making a shirt and not giving it the proper size but overall still a great purchase and a goal to work towards,,,,,,
The long sleeves feels good but the size are a little bigger then what I ordered. I wear a medium but when I put this on, it feels and look a little bigger then medium but a little smaller then a large.,,,,,,
"Great breathable and ultra-light running shirt! The fit for the M is spot on for someone bw around 510 - 62"", with decent chest room (ie not too snug)",,,,,,,
"Comfortable dry-fit long sleeve t-shirt.
Fits well on medium frame-size.
Made in Jordan.",,,,,,,
great for the gym!,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,
Ive bought several of these. Their great to work out in or to lounge around in.,,,,,,,
bought this for a co-worker for secret santa. bought him a medium but it fits like a large. He still uses it though :) shipped and delivered on time,,,,,,,
"This was ordered for my very thin grandson. He usually wears a mens small, but this was still a bit loose in the small, but he still likes it.
",,,,,,,
100f outside and this long sleeve is keeping me cool, love thus shirt buying more,,,,,,
Fits well like to wear to the gym with my Nike Mens Free Trainer 3.0 V3 Training Shoe [Color: Game Royal/White] its a perfect match. When you running keeps the sweat under control. This way when you leave the gym you arent exposed to the cold air. I have few brands of shirts, but actually find these the most comfortable.,,,,,,
Just as you would expect. But smaller than most. Would get the next size up,,,,,,,
"Nice fit
not see through own two",,,,,,,
shirt feels very good on skin. keeps you cool and fits as expected,,,,,,,
I would recommend. Love the fit and color. No surprises here.,,,,,,,
Very good shirt made with nice expensive looking material. The shirt fits very well. I purchased the purple because most of the other colors were sold out in large. I was skeptical of the color because its purple. However, the shirt looks really good on.,,,,,,
Bought it for a Christmas gift & they loved it,,,,,,,
great shirt - fits accordingly and looks great - highly recommend,,,,,,,
"I ordered size M, its a little tight around chest, sending it back.

The material is dri-fit, very thin, but durable, not too bad for $32 I paid.",,,,,,,
A little oversized, decent quality.,,,,,,
I love this ! I would buy more!,,,,,,,
Nice color and fit,,,,,,,
Came in as red and not maroon my boyfriend ended up keeping it but now he has two of the same color,,,,,,,
Dont typically buy clothing from Amazon, but my husband has a NIKE Black long sleeve crew and wanted a white one. The size is accurate.,,,,,,
The outside tag said Large but when tried on realized it was very tight. The inside tag showed it was a small.,,,,,,,
exelent,,,,,,,
some of these run so small like they are meant for undershirts or workout only but this is a good shirt for relaxing or casual wear no form fitting,,,,,,,
I bought this lightweight dry fit for my husband to wear to the gym. He loves it. It provides extra warmth under his t shirt because our gym is always freezing cold. I bought a medium, he weighs about 165 and is 5 10 and it fits true to size.,,,,,,
great!!!,,,,,,,
Got for my father-in-law for Christmas, who usually wears a Tall, and it fit very well. He loved it so much he wore it two days in a row! LOL!,,,,,
Nice Shirt.,,,,,,,
Great fit and quality, exactly what I needed,,,,,,
Fits well throughout chest and back etc. Was expecting more of a tight fit through the arms however and wrists, however. All in all a great shirt though.,,,,,,
Great purchase. Im 62 200 pounds and ordered a large. The shirt fits great and came MUCH faster than the ETA,,,,,,,
The upper part of the sleeves are oddly baggy, while the lower forearm fits as expected. My husband isnt really a fan of it, but I think I will try to alter it so the upper arms fit more like they should.,,,,,
Great shirt for the price....Very comfortable!,,,,,,,
I was very disappointed. It was thinner and more see-through than the picture depicted. I will just use it as an undershirt on a cold day.,,,,,,,
Arrived on time and looks okay - not really impressed with the material and it had a weird smell to it when it first arrived.,,,,,,,
you can buy it at the same price outside.,,,,,,,
I bought two of these and love them. Loose fitting and lightweight. Perfect for working, hiking/camping, or just lounging around the house.,,,,,
Fits beautifully,,,,,,,
Love this shirt. Excellent for working out in or just casual wear.,,,,,,,
I have three of these all different colors. Ordered them from the same place. Fast shipping! Will buy a few more in different colors soon.,,,,,,,
"A gift for my hubby, He is 511"" 173lbs, I got him size L. It fits well.",,,,,,,
Bought it for my husband, looks And fits great,,,,,,
It was perfect just what my grandson wanted. The fit was just right, the purple was a beautiful color. Very pleased.,,,,,,
Perfect fit, great for running.,,,,,,
For some reason this fabric snags very easily on velcro. (the hook side). I have a dozen of these NikeFit that I bought years ago that dont do that.,,,,,,,
Bit larger than description.,,,,,,,
These are sized a little bigger than you would think or are used too. But the quality is still the NIKE quality. I would easy buy again.,,,,,,,
An excellent & interesting transaction,,,,,,,
Dri-Fit T-shirts are a great idea. I wear it when I play tennis in the sun to keep the sun off of my arms. It is great!,,,,,,,
I really love this as a long sleeve under shirt, under my golf polo shirts. Or can be worn as an outer shirt, its not very heavy, very light breathable material,,,,
"Great fit , exactly as described, fast delivery
I would order from this seller again",,,,,,,
My husband loves these shirts for running in the winter. Bought as a Christmas present.,,,,,,,
"I bought this t-shirt for my daughters boy friend he loved it.
Beautiful blue",,,,,,,
My husband really likes these shirts and this one is one of his favorites. Its thin enough to wear underneath a sweatshirt/fleece or to layer over a tshirt. Dri-fit material.,,,,,,,
It is great and my nephew loved it, the material was comfortable and the fit was good,,,,,,
Bought as a gift for my brother - he loves it! Stated is was comfortable and washed great. He is tall and has broad shoulders - fit great all the way around.,,,,,,,
Perfect shirt if you are running outdoors in the winter or late fall. It fits loose and is very comfortable! I would definitely reccommend this product.,,,,,,,
Great shirt, cool, nice material. Fits a littler big but is great for exercising when it is not that hot out.,,,,,
I rock one of these in a different color at least 5 days a week. Theyre legit af,,,,,,,
Arms are a bit tight where they attach to the body. Otherwise fits as expected.,,,,,,,
All perfect, thanks!!!!,,,,,,
Was not what i expected, please be careful of what the item description says and what your expectations are.,,,,,,
??,,,,,,,
Slow ship but worth the wait.,,,,,,,
I am somewhat dissapointed with how dark the color of the shirt is .,,,,,,,
Great long sleeve running shirt. Ive owned these before so no big surprise.,,,,,,,
Nike is still the best dry fit weave available, Ive bought adidas and others but they can be scratchy.,,,,,,
This shirt will get you hella chicks,,,,,,,
Too thin !Long sleeves!,,,,,,,
Fits perfectly and material is light for late spring/early fall weather in the mid-west.,,,,,,,
You get what you pay for. Very thin, badly fitting shirt,,,,,,
Fits good, but this is way light weight. In fact you can see right thought this shirt? For the price I thought it would be higher quality Nike.,,,,,,
Nice quality and good finishing as well. If you have an athletic body type this would look perfect. I use these for gym and dont feel sweaty.,,,,,,,
Bought a medium; small would probably be the right fit,,,,,,,
Fits just as expected. Im very happy with my purchase,,,,,,,
Great color,though i wish the swoosh was embroidered..,,,,,,
Ive bought several of these & they are a good look & so comfortable!,,,,,,,
"It isnt made of the same material as the ""Nike Dri-fit"". The item is also too small.
Not happy with this purchase.",,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
I was skeptical, but believe all the other reviewers now- this runs really a size or size and a half big. I usually wear a L, but this was the biggest, longest M Ive ever seen!,,,,
Fits perfectly. Feels great in the heat considering I walk all day as a letter carrier.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt, fits very good. Like the fabric. Will be good sun protection without being too hot.,,,,,,
I like the color, the fit, the weight (perfect for coolish summer days).,,,,,
Loved it!,,,,,,,
Awesome shirt and fits as expected..,,,,,,,
Loose sleeves exactly what I wanted for bug protection.,,,,,,,
Fits slightly bigger than expected, but great product. Exactly what I was looking for!,,,,,,
Light and dry feel.,,,,,,,
My husband likes this shirt a lot,,,,,,,
The material is strange. Tends to hold body odor and doesnt breathe well. Not liking it so far,,,,,,,
Grandson was very proud of it.,,,,,,,
great fit, just what i wanted,,,,,,
very nice fit true to sizing,,,,,,,
Shirt fits loosely, but is true to size.,,,,,,
Shirt was the perfect gift.,,,,,,,
Good shirt but doesnt fit as expected.,,,,,,,

Bought this as a gift for a friend at the gym. He loved it and it fits him great.,,,,,,,
very comfortable shirt.,,,,,,,
Great shirt. Love it!,,,,,,,
Its a nice shirt, but it was for my 13 year old son and it almost fits my husband who wears a large.,,,,,,

Great shirt.,,,,,,,

I purchased for travel. Stores well in the suit case and is comfortable for travel or by the pool. You cant go wrong.,,,,,,,

Very good Dri-Fit long sleeve shirt for running in cool weather.,,,,,,,
Absolutely Perfect!!,,,,,,,
Good quality...good fit.....nice material for a trip as it is easy to clean,,,,,,,
great shirt, very comfortable and form fitting,,,,,,
These shirts are great for working out. Keeps you dry and very comfortable. I have used them for hiking in cold weather as well as an undershirt to wick sweat away.,,,,,,,
Item as described,,,,,,,
Awesome like all things Nike. The only thing is the neck line runs a little loose for my liking. A thicker seam on the neckline would make this shirt perfect.,,,,,,,
Shirt fit as expected and was the exact shade of red I wanted.,,,,,,,
Fits well, easy to wrestle in and work out in,,,,,,
fits great,,,,,,,
Great,,,,,,,
Good shirt!,,,,,,,

Just right,,,,,,,
The shirt fits perfect and the price is alot cheaper than in a store!!,,,,,,,

thx,,,,,,,
Great fit; light weight .Perfect to work out in which was just what he wanted.,,,,,,,
This shirt is great for warming up, light workouts, or running outside/on the treadmill. It fits really well, and is thin so it is very breathable.,,,,
Extraordinarily thin material. Maybe thats the way it is supposed to be.,,,,,,,
Very good,,,,,,,
thank you,,,,,,,

Excelent,,,,,,,
#swag,,,,,,,
good for price,,,,,,,
It fit well.,,,,,,,
Fast shipping. Exactly what i wanted,,,,,,,
Shirt fits very well, is very soft and comfortable. I ordered a few more in other colors. Good for exercising.,,,,,,
as expected,,,,,,,
fits great,,,,,,,
Ordered a size small...it was huge...and I am 5.10 and 150 LBs...,,,,,,,
Love these Nike Dri-Fit crew tops. Long sleeve or short sleeve they make for great casual shirts or workout shirts. Theyre breathable, durable, and fashionable. The heather grey color is my favorite. I bought this one to replace the one I let my friend borrow(which he has yet to return). Great product!,,,,,
My son wanted to purchase this. While I felt it was a bit overpriced, he was very happy with it. The material is very breathable.,,,,,,
Bought it for my husband. He loves these dry-fit tees and wanted this color. He was somewhat disappointed because it fit him larger than the other long sleeve dry-fit Nike tees that he has bought in the past. For future buyers, I recommend buying a size smaller.,,,,,,
Fit perfect - large as expected. Great material that dries quick.,,,,,,,
is bad,,,,,,,
I use this for golf when I go to practice and occasionally play. Feels great in Texas summers at 100+ degree heat. Usually a concern for me is how see threw the white is but I have not had that problem with this product! Am going to buy more and get a polo version as well,,,,,,,
This is a nice product, but the arms are very long compared with the body. If you need a shirt for a bigger body, but dont have particularly long arms, you may want to look at other similar products.,,,,
It doesnt feel like a Nike product. Looks like a cheap rip off.,,,,,,,
Solid shirt. I got this item for the gym but I also wear it when Im not in the gym. It is light so it is very breathable. I have a few short sleeve versions of this shirt but I think Ill be getting more of these in the future.,,,,,,,
"Really like the shirt but it definitely runs large. I am 62"" and the sleeves are long and the neck opening is larger than I would like. Really wish I had ordered a size smaller but stuck with an expensive t-shirt.",,,,,,,
Fit perfectly,,,,,,,
Very nice fit, color very true to picture and size was very accurate, my husband loved it,,,,,
The only problem I have is that I paid 30 dollars for a 28 dollar shirt. Thats what it said on the tag !! I should have looked further for a better deal !!,,,,,,,
I would advise anyone purchasing to order a size down. I ordered a medium and it looks like a large plus its a very loose material so that makes it even bigger fitting.,,,,,,,
My husband really likes this shirt however it swallows him. And the sleeves are long. Still giving 4 stars because for someone that it fits it would be perfect.,,,,,,,
This is a nice shirt for working out or casual wear. It is really thin material so can be worn in summer too. It fits nice, not super tight but like a t-shirt.,,,,,,
The shirt arrived quickly, and his extremely comfortable. I recommend this product for anyone that is interested in being comfortable while working out.,,,,,,
Everything arrived on time and in good condition. Great product for working out - exactly what I was hoping for / expected. Happy with my purchase,,,,,,,
He said its light weight very comfortable. As for me the wash, Can wear right out of dryer and its looks brand new. I bought all colors for him.,,,,,,
"The material is cheap. Not what I expected from reading the reviews. Ive bought actual Nike ""dri-fit"" from Nike and those were actually very durable and warm. This material is very thin. If you want it just for looks for the gym, I guess its ok but for its purpose -dont buy",,,,,,,
It doesnt seem authentic. It was huge. Small fit like a large. Material isnt similar to Nikes shirts.,,,,,,,
To large for me,,,,,,,
I ordered an XL and I received an XL Tall. Does not fit well at all. Product is not as described.,,,,,,,
Great it is exactly what I ordered.....great product and great price, would order more of these in the future for sure,,,,,,
The shirt was a little too big but I still use it. It works great and worth the price I paid.,,,,,,,
Excellent quality. My grandson loved it and it looked great on him. Very pleased.,,,,,,,
S Size was a bit large and wide for me in the sleeves, but still being a good product!,,,,,,
this product is very good, apart from their arrival shipping services consider them the best,,,,,,
Good fit and so far good quality to resistance to wear and tear,,,,,,,
No comment,,,,,,,
Nice Long Sleeve!,,,,,,,
great product snd customer service,,,,,,,
Its ok,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
Dont buy it. When i saw this first time in my eyes, i couldnt believe my eyes. I ordered T-shirt not dress. So I measured this stupid long bodied T-shirt, it was 29.5 inches. How can man have a body lengths of 29.5 inches? Besides the fact that i am Asian, this T-shirt is way too long.,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
I was expecting more of an under armor type of shirt. you know, tightly fit on the sleeves to show off biceps.? A bit loose on the arms and short in length of the entire shirt. fits kind of awkward for my taste. Good material though.,,,,,,
I hate the fit as that the large fits like a normal x-large. Something was wrong with the sizing.,,,,,,,
About 100% sure this shirt isnt a real Nike Dri-Fit. I own about 4 different Dri-fits and this one is counterfeit. The Nike swoosh looks and feels fake, the fabric doesnt feel like a Dri fit.,,,,,,
Excelente. Continuaré comprando a este vendedor. Tienda recomendada para hacer más compras internacionales. GRACIAS POR LA VENTA DEL PRODUCTO. SALUDOS,,,,,,,
Comfy sweater especially for work in the spring and fall,,,,,,,
I initially ordered a couple of these Nike long sleeve shirts in a couple of colors to check out the quality of the material and the workmanship. Some people had posted that the shirts were too sheer and too light for their use. All I can say is that these shirts are my new faves for working out and for wearing under quarter zip pullover shirts. I think I have ordered a total of six or seven of these shirts in various colors and I was actually contemplating ordering a few more when amazon sent an email message asking me to post a review on these shirts. The shirts are generously sized. The material is high quality and is very comfortable next to my skin, unlike some of my other long sleeve work out shirts. The workmanship is excellent. They come in a wide variety of colors. And, they are only +/- $25.00 each. Believe me, you will not be disappointed. These shirts are a great value. Enjoy... and just do it !!,,,,
This dri fit shirt is made of very very thin/fine fabric. It completely takes to the shape of your body. So unless youve got a banging body this might not be the shirt for you. The other dri fit materials are made of a hardier fabric that can kind of keep their shape. I didnt like this one because of the fit. But if youre a runner looking for a next to naked feeling dri fit shirt, this might be the shirt for you.,,,,,,
Nice shirt. I normally wear an x-lg t-shirt, so I got this in an x-lg as well, but I wish I had opted for a large. This kind of shirt wasnt meant to be this loose. My fault, though, so Im still giving it 5-stars. I guess Ill get another, but in large, and Ill just wear this one while doing yard-work or something. Id recommend you guys to consider getting a size smaller than usual.,
"Found my new favorite shirt(s) can wear it for a run or out to eat and very comfortable. Fits good 5""10 165 lbs size large (maybe a tad loose but not bad) very thin though. Nike makes a version 2.0 to this shirt that has some cotton rather than 100% poly that I like better but still love this shirt.",,,,,,,
"really low quality material for this shirt I was expecting something way better for the price and the Nike brand although Im doubting if its actually legit. The Nike logo isnt reflective neither the ""Dri-Fit"" something I found weird because if you look closely to the other shirts they say NikeFit. My chest is quite visble with this tshirt something that Im not a fan though and I used and sweated it and it doesnt dry as my other Nike or whatever other sport brand tshirt. Sadly Im not in the US otherwise Id ask for a refund.

This review isnt biased. Nobody is paying to talk about the crappy product I bought is just a customers opinion about a con over a ""Nike"" shirt. Sad

Here are some pictures of the product.",,,,,,,
"I bought this shirt b/c I wanted a long sleeve shirt to wear around the house that wasnt too warm. This works perfectly. Its light, cool, and extremely comfortable.

Regarding the size, Im 60 and weight 230. I tend to buy XXL size shirts, but on the suggestion of other reviews, I ordered an XL. The fit is perfect, which is to say that any purchasers should also consider ordering a size smaller than normal.",,,,,,,
"The fabric is thin but nice, its overall a good looking shirt, but I have to return it since it was far too large. I normally order medium (I am 5 10.5), but I ordered small (which is the smallest size available) based on the reviews. Both the shirt and the sleeves are about 1 longer than the maximum that I would tolerate. There is also a lot of extra fabric under the armpits and the shirt fits pretty loosely, so I would just order 1-2 sizes smaller if that was possible. The shirt label says ""S"", so I was sent the correct size.",,,,,,,
Very cheap shirt, not like the photo what so ever. Im not sure why so much good reviews but its the only reason I thought i was getting a nice shirt which is cheap looking shirt, the only reason for the two starts is the super fast shipping!! Not worth the money! Believe me....,,,,,
"Great shirt. Love the material and feel. I usually get a large, but purchased med because of reviews. Fits good but I like shirts to be a little more loose. Going to order a couple more but large this time. Im 510, 180.

11-16-15 I ordered 2 more. I am LE and wear under my uniform. Hold up well and very comfortable.",,,,,,,
"I bought these shirts in 2014 and my initial response to these shirts was they were fantastic. All the seams l lie flat inside and out. Fit was good felt great on so long as I only wore them short term. So for fit and quality of manufacture they would get 5 stars, but this is 2016 and I believe there are some other considerations and technologies that should be added to this type of shirt. I used these shirts as I worked maintenance for a condo and later as a pest control technician.

Having anti-odor/Anti-microbial technology made into the shirt didnt seem that important when I bought these items. However, it has to be if you need to wear a shirt made with this type of fabric longer than a few hours. When I wore these shirts under my short sleeve work shirt they became foul smelling on long hot days. I thought it might be me forgetting deodorant or something, I even carried a spare stick in my truck. After I switched to another brand with anti-odor/Anti-microbial properties I didnt have the odor issues I had with the Nike Dry Fit. So this consideration is rated by me a critical fail.

Additionally these are not advertised as having any sun protection capability, another component I need here in NW Florida. I now wear this type of shirt to play tennis to try to stay cool in the summer and get some protection from the sun to make my dermatologist happy. I want to avoid sunscreen so it doesnt mess up my grip on the racquet. After wearing these shirts for nearly a year my dermatologist treated and area in the middle of my back. Hence my renewed interest in UPF shirts. Again this area is rated by me as a critical fail.

Bottom Line: Just dont, I have to replace these Nike Dry Fit shirts to get the anti-odor/Anti-microbial and UPF 50 capabilities available in other shirts so I wasted my money on Nike. Im trying the Vapor Apparel Mens UPF Long Sleeve Solar Performance T-Shirt as a replacement.",,,,,,,
The Nike Mens Legend Poly Long Sleeve Dri-Fit T-shirt arrived within the scheduled time frame and was exactly as described on the site. It fits well, is very comfortable and I would recommend it to anyone that either works out or, wants to wear it as a long sleeved shirt under a short sleeved shirt.,,,,,
The sleeves are so long. Im 60. 165lbs. I wear an XL. The sleeves hang past my hands about 3-4 inches.,,,,,,,
"I bought this shirt from another site since it was a lot cheaper.

The shirt definitely runs large. Im 510"", 170 lbs, and usually wear mediums for Nike shirts, and they arent too loose on me. I bought a small of this shirt and it fits me very well, you could maybe even say its a little baggy, which is fine with me.

The shirt is thin, made to wear in the summer or for workouts, not the best to keep warm.

However, the shirt is very comfortable and its not too thin that you can see through it.",,,,,,,
This is a nice quality shirt, especially if you order the right size. I ordered it for my husband who is small in stature. He is 5ft. 7 and 150 pounds. I ordered a medium and it fits him very well. He loved the shirt so much that I ordered another one in Maroon. Unfortunately, they sent me the red which is why I only gave four stars as opposed to five. The only reason why I didnt send it back is because my husband decided to go ahead and keep the red even though that is not the color I wanted.,,,,,
Very nice fit and feel.Well made. Its a kind of a semi-mesh fabric that looks to be breathable. Would buy another one anytime soon. Im pleased with my purchase.,,,,,,,
"The picture of the product shows a Nike check.
Be aware the shirt may not have a Nike check.
As seen below, mine did not.",,,,,,,
"PRICED ABOVE MSRP. First thing first. These are Overpriced. This particular Nike Dri-Fit Training shirt has an MSRP of $22 (see picture of the tag from the green shirt for $22 and I paid $24 for it) and most of them listed here are going for $22-$30. That is ridiculous. You can go to Dicks Sporting Goods website and get them for $16.50. I ordered two of these shirts in red and green size XL for $23 and $24 respectively. The only reason I ordered these is because I thought they were the Dri-Fit Ts that normally retail for ~$35 and I thought I was getting a good deal. I have two of the $35 dri-fit t-shirts already, which fit really nice (not tight, I hate tight shirts, but not loose). These cheaper dri-fit t-shirts fit much larger than the $35 ones (see picture red $22 MSRP from amazon on left and navy $35 MSRP from Dicks on right, both XL). I am 63"", 230 lbs and the XL feels like I am wearing a dress.

I will be returning these shirts. I paid too much for what they actually are, and on top of that the fit is a little on the large size. There is no problem with the shirts quality wise, besides the larger fit. But if you do want one of these, do yourself a favor and dont order from here. Order it from Dicks for $16.50.",,,,,,,
"Fantastic product, the high quality stuff you expect from Nike.

Fits a tad large, but this is a performance shirt, so the idea behind it is to remove swear from the body and dry out. Dont expect this to hug at all, its meant to be a tad loose.

Awesome for warmer climates and situations where you gotta sweat but stay cool!",,,,,,,
Nice, comfortable shirt. I wear it playing tennis, jogging, boating, or just out running errands. It does seem to run a bit large, and long, but not so bad that I dont like it. I have several colors, and it is odd that they have such a wide range of prices. White was cheapest.
Im such a big fan of this running and workout shirt. It wicks moisture very well. I actually use it for hiking to keep my body cool, especially as a base layer during the spring or early fall.,,,,,,
The Nike Mens Legend shirt fit great for my son. He used it at summer camp as he was part of the purple cabin. He wore the shirt for all types of activities including game time, lunch/dinner, free time and various sporting events. The shirt did a great job wicking moisture away from his body and provided great protection from the elements. I would recommend this shirt as a great outdoor/indoor activity shirt.,,,,,
Nice fit and wears as advertised. Dri material retains slight smell after a few wears and washes. Does seem to go away after a deep soak and cleanse.,,,,,,,
Awesome and comfortable shirt! I wear when working out, playing tennis, and just around the house. Good price as well!,,,,,
This particular shirt came quite a bit larger than my other Medium Nike Dri-Fits. I noticed they were all made in different countries, so that might be the issue. Ill try and buy these shirts from local stores to make sure its the nice tight fit I was hoping for.,,,,,,
"Not yellow
It is a puke color and it was wadded up in the package
Don’t think it’s original nike",,,,,,,
Definitely great and authentic Nike quality, but a bit too large. Ordered a 2x, and its seriously huge.,,,,,
Quality is good but its extremely LARGE. Im 60 220pounds and the size large was dancing over my body,,,,,,,
Comfortable and fits well. I bought it late spring and have only worn it for a short run, but it breathed well. Would highly recommend it.,,,,,,
Purchased them for my daughter in law and she loves them. Very well made.,,,,,,,
fav longsleeve to work out it. i got the red/burgandy and always get compliments on the color,,,,,,,
Perfect Shirt, I love the high quality and it is very comfortable and light for the summer! I gave 4 stars because is a little large for me.,,,,,,
Great sports gear and my daughter loves them.,,,,,,,
It is an excellent product,,,,,,,
PERFECT ORANGE & FITS GREAT!,,,,,,,
Great looking casual shirt,,,,,,,
Very nice warm weather top for active sports.,,,,,,,
very thin fabric,,,,,,,
As noted, fit the person it was for great.,,,,,,
nice,,,,,,,
Just received the shirts and they fit as expected. Im very happy.,,,,,,,
XS is good fit but sleeves were too tight.,,,,,,,
I got this shirt today and I made the mistake to go by the size chart! Im 5ft 137lbs and according to the chart Im large but is way-way too big on me, Im returning this item.,,,,,,
I didnt realize this shirt was sheer. Super disappointed. I thought Id be able to wear it out for running errands & working out, but now I have to send it back.,,,,,,
Itchy... material not soft.,,,,,,,
Perfect for what I needed,,,,,,,
Cotton material, NOT dri-fit material. Not tight and I got an XS. Still a cute shirt but,,,,,,
Perfect,,,,,,,
I ordered a extra Large like all my others. This seems to run way small. Order up a size or two.,,,,,,,
I wear this every Monday Wednesday and Friday when I work on my upper body, it feels great! I love how it feels, I dont feel all nasty and wet and feel like my clothes is sticking to my body after Im done with my work out, not tight nice and loose, some people might not like it like that but I do, I recommend if you want it a little tight then get a size lower, I got the size I wear on my regular shirts and it was a little big but I like it like that.,
My husband loves these shirts!,,,,,,,
"The fit is good and I think for most people these would be perfect. I find I am always between sizes and this is no exception. My shoulders stick out a bit more than I would desire and the neck and arm holes are snug. I am 6 and weigh 175 43"" chest, 33"" waist so finding clothes is hard for me. Nonetheless these are high quality shirts that I will happily wear. They are a bit pricey for a sleeveless tee but they are Nike.",,,,,,,
"Fit was great, love the color, husband liked the ""muscle t"" look with the wider tank straps.",,,,,,,
super comfortable shirt,,,,,,,
Fits well and feels good,,,,,,,
Great shirt,,,,,,,
The shirt is fine but I got a medium and it is a little large. If you like your workout shirts a little looser than this is a good choice.,,,,,,,
I am very disappointed by the quality of this T shirt. It has a low quality material and does not compare to other Nike Dri-Fit clothing which we have bought in the past. After washing it once following the instructions it came out of the washer all fluffy with lots of lints on it (see the attached photo). I would not recommend buying it if you are looking for a good quality Dri-Fit T.,,,,,,,

This fits differently than my original Dri-Fit shirt, which I love. The shoulders are smaller, the material is different and a lighter weight (a little bit of see-through), and the torso is blousier. If you have broad or muscley shoulders, it will feel a bit tight. Overall weird fit for me.,,,
Seems to be cheaper material than Nikes other dry-fit shirts. A little long and loose around the waist, but I prefer that over being tight.,,,,,,
Will defiantly be replacing all my casual shirts with these in every color. Very nice material breaths well without being see through. Streatchy so very comfortable and perfect for outdoor activities and exercising drys quick exactly what it was supposed to do!,,,,,,,
I am a plus size after having a baby. I read the reviews of all those who said it ran large. I usually size up when buying online but due to those reviews I bought my usual size. This thing does not run big..,,,,,,,
The image is of a sports bra rather than of the black shirt I got for workouts.,,,,,,,
Fit really small but love the feel of the material wish it wouldve fit right,,,,,,,
"Great shirt for the gym. The M fit is somewhat loose, which I expected for the style.

Two stars because this shirt retails at $24.99 on the tag. Theyre selling at a premium.

My advice, wait until the price drops to at least $20 to get a better deal or run out to the nearest sporting goods store and buy one on sale at a retail store.",,,,,,,
I dont like to wear tight clothing when I run, but this was too big.,,,,,,
Excellent fit and the material dries fast. Great value and great design for workout or even casual wear.,,,,,,,
1.5 sizes too big but wearable. If wear a medium maybe opt for a small.,,,,,,,
Fit well and tighter than the Nike Womens Miler Short sleeve top,,,,,,,
Love this, its light weight and not clingy. I will be ordering again...,,,,,,
Comfy, however, little thick (warm) for summers,,,,,
This is more see through than the old dri-fit shirts. Its also on the large side. Im usually between a small and medium and I got the small but it was still a bit large after a few rounds in the dryer on high. Pretty color though and seems like its made well.,,,,,,,
"i dont know what happened but I bought 2 dry-fit T shirts size L (I have one M and it is a little tight thats why I bought L), but what I received wasnt what I expected. I had to give them to my husband and they fit them ok.
I am in argentina so I cant sned them back.
It was a waste of money.",,,,,,,
Niceeee nicceeee shirt,,,,,,,
Love Nike gear,,,,,,,
good quality,,,,,,,
Good shirt!,,,,,,,
Not even the same shirt that was shown! The purple is actually a dark pinkish color not a deep purple like what is in the images and description. It doesnt have the nike logo on the front and it has mesh on the back and sides. Not at all what was shown in the pictures.,,,,,,,
The color. Was not what the web site showed.,,,,,,,
Great Shirt,,,,,,,
Arrived quickly and great price!,,,,,,,
Ordered the Royal blue . Its much much brighter than the picture. Also ordered an XS and is still too big. Cannot wear it for this race.,,,,,,,
Nice color,,,,,,,
Nice color - if you are looking for a fitted look this is not the shirt - I wear a medium and its a little big - but the small would have been to small,,,,,,,
Wonderful shirt! Looks great and feels better. My daughter typically wears a womens small to med.so we hot small and its still loose,,,,,,,
Love this shirt!! I use it for my gym workouts, very comfortable and goes with everything.,,,,,,
Nice fit and very light,,,,,,,
It was larger than I expected. I should have ordered a small one for next time. But overall its comfortable for workout so Im happy with it.,,,,,,,
I received this shirt the day after I ordered it! And then ordered it in another color because of how perfect it is,,,,,,,
I love this material. When I work out and wear this shirt I dont feel like it weighs me down when I sweat,,,,,,,
Nothing like last years Legend Tee which fit better and I liked the material better.,,,,,,,
Great condition,,,,,,,
Fits great, nice material!,,,,,,
Its bit large but I like that for my jiu jitsu class.. Good buy and fast delivery,,,,,,,
very bad quality......the logo not white,its gray logo......its exist in local market by 3 usd,,,,,,
You can find a better product fot that price, too expensive and not that great,,,,,,
Very nice,,,,,,,
Excellent fit! Quality fabric. Love the color. Holds up to frequent washing and drying. Couldnt be happier.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt!,,,,,,,
Perfect cut. Not too tight but has a feminine, not boxy, cut. Love it.,,,,,
Color is not as shown, fit is loose.,,,,,,
Wish it was just a bit bigger in width. But it is just what I wanted for looks. Very comfortable. I have washed it and it did not shrink.,,,,,,,
Perfect, it was a gift, She loved it,,,,,
Color is it even close to what is pictured. Its is not a bright gold/yellow.. its a dull tan/pale gold color,,,,,,,
This shirt is the only shirt I use for exercising. I have five of them and love them. The fit is perfect.,,,,,,,
perfect fit,,,,,,,
It wasnt as nice as the one with the same name (DriFit) purchased in a store; its a very thin material.,,,,,,,
Clearly not a real small!,,,,,,,
Great fit, true to size,,,,,,
arrived in time for Christmas. Fit perfectly.,,,,,,,
Arrived on time and exactly as described.,,,,,,,
Thinner than some of my other Nike tops but a good length. I would buy again!,,,,,,,
Fits my wife perfectly. Looks great and keeps you cool on hot days!,,,,,,,
Grandaughter loves it !,,,,,,,
Great length and light weight. True to color,,,,,,,
The fit was as expected. Im very happy with this shirt. Its soft, thick enough to not see through and long enough so I can go through airport security and raise my arms without showing my stomach. I love it,,,,,,
Great t-shirt but runs small. Very fit cut,,,,,,,
good, but I had a mistake when I choose the size, it is too long, it covered my hip,,,,
This is not yellow. It is beige. I like the shirt but dont order unless you want beige.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt feels great,,,,,,,
Love it,,,,,,,
Runs a tiny bit large but fast shipping and exactly what I was looking for,,,,,,,
Runs long, but happy to have senior rear covered.,,,,,,
Fitted as expected! Keeps me cool during a workout,,,,,,,
What i wanted,,,,,,,
Love it,,,,,,,
"i hate this shirt. it is NOT like my other Nike crew neck dry fit shirt.
they obviously discountinued the one i like because i cant find it anywhere.
this is not a fitted shirt. i wear a small( in a fitted shirt) this one fits baggy and loose and long.",,,,,,,
Great material and comfort,,,,,,,
ok,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,
Love it!!,,,,,,,
Very cool garment; will enjoy wearing it!,,,,,,,
I LOVE IT!,,,,,,,
Love it! Easy handling when traveling.,,,,,,,
Excellent product , highly recommended.,,,,,,
This is a nice basic workout t-shirt. It keeps you dry, fit well and is comfortable.,,,,,,
Great fit.,,,,,,,
I didnt like the quality!,,,,,,,
Love this,,,,,,,
Fits comfortably,,,,,,,
Very confortable,,,,,,,
Great top for soccer.,,,,,,,
Ok a bit long...,,,,,,,
Super large neck line,,,,,,,
I bought this shirt thinking the size would run large as thats what many of the reviews said. I did not feel that way about this shirt. I did not like the way it fit me. I am pretty broad and chesty and this shirt was definitely unflattering. It is made for very slim and petite women, not for me. I returned it immediately.,,,,,,
Bought this for my older sister as a christimas present. She loves it so much and commonly gets compliments on it! I plan on getting her a few more next christmas.,,,,,,,
Good as expected.,,,,,,,
Great feeling, rapids drying shirts. Planning a motorcycle trip and taking along a few of these. Rinse out at night and let hand dry.,,,,,,
Great fit, super comfortable, warm, but doesnt make you sweat. Its a perfect workout shirt or great for wearing under a jersey.,,,,
"I enjoy this shirt, as it works for what I intended it for. It was a little bigger than expected, bigger than many other ""Large"" shirts I have but not overly large. Its just a bit loose and a little thin, thats all. Works great though, as I use it as an undershirt in layering for the upper Midwest winters, as it can be quite cold up here. Comfortable, but it should be a bit cheaper, like $20 would be more acceptable. My main gripe is that Nike is really pushing it selling it for about $30 (for just a plain white t-shirt!) just because they can.",,,,,,,
This shirt is very nice, I bought the green one for my husband. The material is thinner but it falls and fits very nice, it does not cling. I highly recommend this shirt.,,,,,
These teet-shirts fit the way I wanted them to, for the size I thought. I have no problem ordering the way I had , thank you.,,,,,
Nice lightweight shirt. Great for working out, or wearing in the sun when you need extra coverage, but want to stay cool.,,,,,
some what too large but good quality sleeves a little too long also good quality so i gave it 3 stars no i would not buy again,,,,,,,
Great training shirt. Dont expect these to keep you warm as they are pretty thin, however they are very nice and soft and looks great. Its a somewhat fitted shirt, so make sure you dont have a tummy or it will show lol.,,,,,
My husband loves this Tee. He washes it in woolite and hang to dry. Last a long time!,,,,,,,
Comfortable, but like any other white workout shirt, will stain with sunscreen.,,,,,
My significant other was very happy with the material of this shirt and it fit perfect,,,,,,,
The sizes run smaller than most, had to return it. Sorry to say they didnt have same in larger sizes.,,,,,,
Excellent quality and price. Fit perfectly. My husband love it.,,,,,,,
Cheap quality with thin material. Not happy with what I got for the price.,,,,,,,
Warm yet cool, looks fresh and feels great. No issues, fits well.,,,,,
Needed a purple shirt. This was a great choice.,,,,,,,
Great Fit! Perfect Wash and Wear!!,,,,,,,
Son loves it. He looks good in it,,,,,,,
Great product, great seller!!!,,,,,,
Im slightly disappointed because the image I viewed appeared that the product faded from a washed out purple to a saturated purple below the shoulders. I referenced the same image while writing this review and have determined that flood lighting is creating a washed out effect on the promotional image. I used the item as a wind breaker over a sweat shirt for a team event that required a purple shirt. I will normally use it as a winter running shirt.,,,,,,,
too big not matter what size,,,,,,,
love the design and fit,,,,,,,
A little bit longer on sleeves than hope for but all in all great!,,,,,,,
nice shirt, comfy and well made,,,,,,
Looks great and fits well,,,,,,,
a gift and was loved,,,,,,,
Another satisfied customer,,,,,,,
Fits great. Extra coverage to keep the sun off during the long runs. Easy clean. Love it!,,,,,,,
Got it for our son-in-law for Christmas - he loved it and has worn it several times!,,,,,,,
Great color and size is a good fit. Happy with purchase.,,,,,,,
Fantastic product. Im absolutely in love with Nike Dri-Fit products,,,,,,,
I got this shirt as a gift for my boyfriend and he really likes it. It fits as expected and he likes that its light on him while he runs. Very timely shipping!,,,,,,,
I purchased one of these in hope of finding something that is light enough to wear and use at the gym, but still thick enough to where my nips wouldnt be popping out the whole time. Im pleased with the buy. The quality is great. Im 511 and weigh about 165-70. I went with a large and am happy i did so. Wear a tank top underneath though. If your gym is cold your nips mighy show.,,,,,,
Very good quality. Great value.,,,,,,,
Fits nice and feels good.,,,,,,,
Comfy,,,,,,,
Excellent product, price and shipping,,,,,,
Fits perfect,,,,,,,
Nice shirt. I have one in gray and now this one in white. I like the fit, i.e., not baggy, and the thinness of the fabric. Other brands are thicker, and I find that makes me too hot while exercising. Also great to wear in the sun.,,,
Bought this for my son and he loves it! Fits as expected!,,,,,,,
This is made in Mexico. The Vietnam fabric is much better.,,,,,,,
I liked this Nike long sleeve a lot.,,,,,,,
Too large,,,,,,,
Great,,,,,,,
I got the large. It looks great, however really is....welll.... quite large. I am 6 feet tall, around 200 pounds with a relatively athletic physique and this is still quite a bit too big on me. Feels more like an extra large. Insanely comfortable though and it still looks great. I would just size down if at all possible.,,,,,
I bought this shirt for longer runs (10+ miles) here in Central Florida on days when it is typically over 90 degrees and over 90% humidity. It definitely makes a difference with the white color as it is highly reflective and keeps you cooler in that regard. Secondly, you are now evaporating sweat from both your skin and the shirt, creating a better core temp cooling mechanism. I recommend.,,,,,
Super super comfortable an awesome looking but the only problem is when you order a large it comes in a slightly smaller size so its not Amazons fault, but rather Nikes for making a shirt and not giving it the proper size but overall still a great purchase and a goal to work towards,,,,,,
The long sleeves feels good but the size are a little bigger then what I ordered. I wear a medium but when I put this on, it feels and look a little bigger then medium but a little smaller then a large.,,,,,,
"Great breathable and ultra-light running shirt! The fit for the M is spot on for someone bw around 510 - 62"", with decent chest room (ie not too snug)",,,,,,,
"Comfortable dry-fit long sleeve t-shirt.
Fits well on medium frame-size.
Made in Jordan.",,,,,,,
great for the gym!,,,,,,,
Nice,,,,,,,
Ive bought several of these. Their great to work out in or to lounge around in.,,,,,,,
bought this for a co-worker for secret santa. bought him a medium but it fits like a large. He still uses it though :) shipped and delivered on time,,,,,,,
"This was ordered for my very thin grandson. He usually wears a mens small, but this was still a bit loose in the small, but he still likes it.
",,,,,,,
100f outside and this long sleeve is keeping me cool, love thus shirt buying more,,,,,,
Fits well like to wear to the gym with my Nike Mens Free Trainer 3.0 V3 Training Shoe [Color: Game Royal/White] its a perfect match. When you running keeps the sweat under control. This way when you leave the gym you arent exposed to the cold air. I have few brands of shirts, but actually find these the most comfortable.,,,,,,
Just as you would expect. But smaller than most. Would get the next size up,,,,,,,
"Nice fit
not see through own two",,,,,,,
shirt feels very good on skin. keeps you cool and fits as expected,,,,,,,
I would recommend. Love the fit and color. No surprises here.,,,,,,,
Very good shirt made with nice expensive looking material. The shirt fits very well. I purchased the purple because most of the other colors were sold out in large. I was skeptical of the color because its purple. However, the shirt looks really good on.,,,,,,
Bought it for a Christmas gift & they loved it,,,,,,,
great shirt - fits accordingly and looks great - highly recommend,,,,,,,
"I ordered size M, its a little tight around chest, sending it back.

The material is dri-fit, very thin, but durable, not too bad for $32 I paid.",,,,,,,
A little oversized, decent quality.,,,,,,
I love this ! I would buy more!,,,,,,,
Nice color and fit,,,,,,,
Came in as red and not maroon my boyfriend ended up keeping it but now he has two of the same color,,,,,,,
Dont typically buy clothing from Amazon, but my husband has a NIKE Black long sleeve crew and wanted a white one. The size is accurate.,,,,,,
The outside tag said Large but when tried on realized it was very tight. The inside tag showed it was a small.,,,,,,,
exelent,,,,,,,
some of these run so small like they are meant for undershirts or workout only but this is a good shirt for relaxing or casual wear no form fitting,,,,,,,
I bought this lightweight dry fit for my husband to wear to the gym. He loves it. It provides extra warmth under his t shirt because our gym is always freezing cold. I bought a medium, he weighs about 165 and is 5 10 and it fits true to size.,,,,,,
great!!!,,,,,,,
Got for my father-in-law for Christmas, who usually wears a Tall, and it fit very well. He loved it so much he wore it two days in a row! LOL!,,,,,
Nice Shirt.,,,,,,,
Great fit and quality, exactly what I needed,,,,,,
Fits well throughout chest and back etc. Was expecting more of a tight fit through the arms however and wrists, however. All in all a great shirt though.,,,,,,
Great purchase. Im 62 200 pounds and ordered a large. The shirt fits great and came MUCH faster than the ETA,,,,,,,
The upper part of the sleeves are oddly baggy, while the lower forearm fits as expected. My husband isnt really a fan of it, but I think I will try to alter it so the upper arms fit more like they should.,,,,,
Great shirt for the price....Very comfortable!,,,,,,,
I was very disappointed. It was thinner and more see-through than the picture depicted. I will just use it as an undershirt on a cold day.,,,,,,,
Arrived on time and looks okay - not really impressed with the material and it had a weird smell to it when it first arrived.,,,,,,,
you can buy it at the same price outside.,,,,,,,
I bought two of these and love them. Loose fitting and lightweight. Perfect for working, hiking/camping, or just lounging around the house.,,,,,
Fits beautifully,,,,,,,
Love this shirt. Excellent for working out in or just casual wear.,,,,,,,
I have three of these all different colors. Ordered them from the same place. Fast shipping! Will buy a few more in different colors soon.,,,,,,,
"A gift for my hubby, He is 511"" 173lbs, I got him size L. It fits well.",,,,,,,
Bought it for my husband, looks And fits great,,,,,,
It was perfect just what my grandson wanted. The fit was just right, the purple was a beautiful color. Very pleased.,,,,,,
Perfect fit, great for running.,,,,,,
For some reason this fabric snags very easily on velcro. (the hook side). I have a dozen of these NikeFit that I bought years ago that dont do that.,,,,,,,
Bit larger than description.,,,,,,,
These are sized a little bigger than you would think or are used too. But the quality is still the NIKE quality. I would easy buy again.,,,,,,,
An excellent & interesting transaction,,,,,,,
Dri-Fit T-shirts are a great idea. I wear it when I play tennis in the sun to keep the sun off of my arms. It is great!,,,,,,,
I really love this as a long sleeve under shirt, under my golf polo shirts. Or can be worn as an outer shirt, its not very heavy, very light breathable material,,,,
"Great fit , exactly as described, fast delivery
I would order from this seller again",,,,,,,
My husband loves these shirts for running in the winter. Bought as a Christmas present.,,,,,,,
"I bought this t-shirt for my daughters boy friend he loved it.
Beautiful blue",,,,,,,
My husband really likes these shirts and this one is one of his favorites. Its thin enough to wear underneath a sweatshirt/fleece or to layer over a tshirt. Dri-fit material.,,,,,,,
It is great and my nephew loved it, the material was comfortable and the fit was good,,,,,,
Bought as a gift for my brother - he loves it! Stated is was comfortable and washed great. He is tall and has broad shoulders - fit great all the way around.,,,,,,,
Perfect shirt if you are running outdoors in the winter or late fall. It fits loose and is very comfortable! I would definitely reccommend this product.,,,,,,,
Great shirt, cool, nice material. Fits a littler big but is great for exercising when it is not that hot out.,,,,,
I rock one of these in a different color at least 5 days a week. Theyre legit af,,,,,,,
Arms are a bit tight where they attach to the body. Otherwise fits as expected.,,,,,,,
All perfect, thanks!!!!,,,,,,
Was not what i expected, please be careful of what the item description says and what your expectations are.,,,,,,
??,,,,,,,
Slow ship but worth the wait.,,,,,,,
I am somewhat dissapointed with how dark the color of the shirt is .,,,,,,,
Great long sleeve running shirt. Ive owned these before so no big surprise.,,,,,,,
Nike is still the best dry fit weave available, Ive bought adidas and others but they can be scratchy.,,,,,,
This shirt will get you hella chicks,,,,,,,
Too thin !Long sleeves!,,,,,,,
Fits perfectly and material is light for late spring/early fall weather in the mid-west.,,,,,,,
You get what you pay for. Very thin, badly fitting shirt,,,,,,
Fits good, but this is way light weight. In fact you can see right thought this shirt? For the price I thought it would be higher quality Nike.,,,,,,
Nice quality and good finishing as well. If you have an athletic body type this would look perfect. I use these for gym and dont feel sweaty.,,,,,,,
Bought a medium; small would probably be the right fit,,,,,,,
Fits just as expected. Im very happy with my purchase,,,,,,,
Great color,though i wish the swoosh was embroidered..,,,,,,
Ive bought several of these & they are a good look & so comfortable!,,,,,,,
"It isnt made of the same material as the ""Nike Dri-fit"". The item is also too small.
Not happy with this purchase.",,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
I was skeptical, but believe all the other reviewers now- this runs really a size or size and a half big. I usually wear a L, but this was the biggest, longest M Ive ever seen!,,,,
Fits perfectly. Feels great in the heat considering I walk all day as a letter carrier.,,,,,,,
Nice shirt, fits very good. Like the fabric. Will be good sun protection without being too hot.,,,,,,
I like the color, the fit, the weight (perfect for coolish summer days).,,,,,
Loved it!,,,,,,,
Awesome shirt and fits as expected..,,,,,,,
Loose sleeves exactly what I wanted for bug protection.,,,,,,,
Fits slightly bigger than expected, but great product. Exactly what I was looking for!,,,,,,
Light and dry feel.,,,,,,,
My husband likes this shirt a lot,,,,,,,
The material is strange. Tends to hold body odor and doesnt breathe well. Not liking it so far,,,,,,,
Grandson was very proud of it.,,,,,,,
great fit, just what i wanted,,,,,,
very nice fit true to sizing,,,,,,,
Shirt fits loosely, but is true to size.,,,,,,
Shirt was the perfect gift.,,,,,,,
Good shirt but doesnt fit as expected.,,,,,,,

Bought this as a gift for a friend at the gym. He loved it and it fits him great.,,,,,,,
very comfortable shirt.,,,,,,,
Great shirt. Love it!,,,,,,,
Its a nice shirt, but it was for my 13 year old son and it almost fits my husband who wears a large.,,,,,,
it is not cotton , it looks like the football Tshirt in its material ,,,,,,
Good quality material,,,,,,,
awesome shirt and buy,,,,,,,
Nice! Love the material!,,,,,,,
A little loose,,,,,,,

Very good Dri-Fit long sleeve shirt for running in cool weather.,,,,,,,
Absolutely Perfect!!,,,,,,,
Good quality...good fit.....nice material for a trip as it is easy to clean,,,,,,,
great shirt, very comfortable and form fitting,,,,,,
These shirts are great for working out. Keeps you dry and very comfortable. I have used them for hiking in cold weather as well as an undershirt to wick sweat away.,,,,,,,
Item as described,,,,,,,
Awesome like all things Nike. The only thing is the neck line runs a little loose for my liking. A thicker seam on the neckline would make this shirt perfect.,,,,,,,
Shirt fit as expected and was the exact shade of red I wanted.,,,,,,,
Fits well, easy to wrestle in and work out in,,,,,,

Great fit; light weight .Perfect to work out in which was just what he wanted.,,,,,,,
This shirt is great for warming up, light workouts, or running outside/on the treadmill. It fits really well, and is thin so it is very breathable.,,,,
Extraordinarily thin material. Maybe thats the way it is supposed to be.,,,,,,,
Very good,,,,,,,

Shirt fits very well, is very soft and comfortable. I ordered a few more in other colors. Good for exercising.,,,,,,
as expected,,,,,,,
fits great,,,,,,,
Ordered a size small...it was huge...and I am 5.10 and 150 LBs...,,,,,,,
Love these Nike Dri-Fit crew tops. Long sleeve or short sleeve they make for great casual shirts or workout shirts. Theyre breathable, durable, and fashionable. The heather grey color is my favorite. I bought this one to replace the one I let my friend borrow(which he has yet to return). Great product!,,,,,
My son wanted to purchase this. While I felt it was a bit overpriced, he was very happy with it. The material is very breathable.,,,,,,
Bought it for my husband. He loves these dry-fit tees and wanted this color. He was somewhat disappointed because it fit him larger than the other long sleeve dry-fit Nike tees that he has bought in the past. For future buyers, I recommend buying a size smaller.,,,,,,
Fit perfect - large as expected. Great material that dries quick.,,,,,,,
is bad,,,,,,,
I use this for golf when I go to practice and occasionally play. Feels great in Texas summers at 100+ degree heat. Usually a concern for me is how see threw the white is but I have not had that problem with this product! Am going to buy more and get a polo version as well,,,,,,,
This is a nice product, but the arms are very long compared with the body. If you need a shirt for a bigger body, but dont have particularly long arms, you may want to look at other similar products.,,,,
It doesnt feel like a Nike product. Looks like a cheap rip off.,,,,,,,
Solid shirt. I got this item for the gym but I also wear it when Im not in the gym. It is light so it is very breathable. I have a few short sleeve versions of this shirt but I think Ill be getting more of these in the future.,,,,,,,
"Really like the shirt but it definitely runs large. I am 62"" and the sleeves are long and the neck opening is larger than I would like. Really wish I had ordered a size smaller but stuck with an expensive t-shirt.",,,,,,,
Fit perfectly,,,,,,,
Very nice fit, color very true to picture and size was very accurate, my husband loved it,,,,,
The only problem I have is that I paid 30 dollars for a 28 dollar shirt. Thats what it said on the tag !! I should have looked further for a better deal !!,,,,,,,
I would advise anyone purchasing to order a size down. I ordered a medium and it looks like a large plus its a very loose material so that makes it even bigger fitting.,,,,,,,
My husband really likes this shirt however it swallows him. And the sleeves are long. Still giving 4 stars because for someone that it fits it would be perfect.,,,,,,,
This is a nice shirt for working out or casual wear. It is really thin material so can be worn in summer too. It fits nice, not super tight but like a t-shirt.,,,,,,
The shirt arrived quickly, and his extremely comfortable. I recommend this product for anyone that is interested in being comfortable while working out.,,,,,,
Everything arrived on time and in good condition. Great product for working out - exactly what I was hoping for / expected. Happy with my purchase,,,,,,,
He said its light weight very comfortable. As for me the wash, Can wear right out of dryer and its looks brand new. I bought all colors for him.,,,,,,
"The material is cheap. Not what I expected from reading the reviews. Ive bought actual Nike ""dri-fit"" from Nike and those were actually very durable and warm. This material is very thin. If you want it just for looks for the gym, I guess its ok but for its purpose -dont buy",,,,,,,
It doesnt seem authentic. It was huge. Small fit like a large. Material isnt similar to Nikes shirts.,,,,,,,
To large for me,,,,,,,
I ordered an XL and I received an XL Tall. Does not fit well at all. Product is not as described.,,,,,,,
Great it is exactly what I ordered.....great product and great price, would order more of these in the future for sure,,,,,,
The shirt was a little too big but I still use it. It works great and worth the price I paid.,,,,,,,
Excellent quality. My grandson loved it and it looked great on him. Very pleased.,,,,,,,
S Size was a bit large and wide for me in the sleeves, but still being a good product!,,,,,,
this product is very good, apart from their arrival shipping services consider them the best,,,,,,
Good fit and so far good quality to resistance to wear and tear,,,,,,,
No comment,,,,,,,
Nice Long Sleeve!,,,,,,,
great product snd customer service,,,,,,,
Its ok,,,,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
Dont buy it. When i saw this first time in my eyes, i couldnt believe my eyes. I ordered T-shirt not dress. So I measured this stupid long bodied T-shirt, it was 29.5 inches. How can man have a body lengths of 29.5 inches? Besides the fact that i am Asian, this T-shirt is way too long.,,,,
Good,,,,,,,
I was expecting more of an under armor type of shirt. you know, tightly fit on the sleeves to show off biceps.? A bit loose on the arms and short in length of the entire shirt. fits kind of awkward for my taste. Good material though.,,,,,,
I hate the fit as that the large fits like a normal x-large. Something was wrong with the sizing.,,,,,,,
About 100% sure this shirt isnt a real Nike Dri-Fit. I own about 4 different Dri-fits and this one is counterfeit. The Nike swoosh looks and feels fake, the fabric doesnt feel like a Dri fit.,,,,,,
Excelente. Continuaré comprando a este vendedor. Tienda recomendada para hacer más compras internacionales. GRACIAS POR LA VENTA DEL PRODUCTO. SALUDOS,,,,,,,
Comfy sweater especially for work in the spring and fall,,,,,,,
I initially ordered a couple of these Nike long sleeve shirts in a couple of colors to check out the quality of the material and the workmanship. Some people had posted that the shirts were too sheer and too light for their use. All I can say is that these shirts are my new faves for working out and for wearing under quarter zip pullover shirts. I think I have ordered a total of six or seven of these shirts in various colors and I was actually contemplating ordering a few more when amazon sent an email message asking me to post a review on these shirts. The shirts are generously sized. The material is high quality and is very comfortable next to my skin, unlike some of my other long sleeve work out shirts. The workmanship is excellent. They come in a wide variety of colors. And, they are only +/- $25.00 each. Believe me, you will not be disappointed. These shirts are a great value. Enjoy... and just do it !!,,,,
This dri fit shirt is made of very very thin/fine fabric. It completely takes to the shape of your body. So unless youve got a banging body this might not be the shirt for you. The other dri fit materials are made of a hardier fabric that can kind of keep their shape. I didnt like this one because of the fit. But if youre a runner looking for a next to naked feeling dri fit shirt, this might be the shirt for you.,,,,,,
Nice shirt. I normally wear an x-lg t-shirt, so I got this in an x-lg as well, but I wish I had opted for a large. This kind of shirt wasnt meant to be this loose. My fault, though, so Im still giving it 5-stars. I guess Ill get another, but in large, and Ill just wear this one while doing yard-work or something. Id recommend you guys to consider getting a size smaller than usual.,
"Found my new favorite shirt(s) can wear it for a run or out to eat and very comfortable. Fits good 5""10 165 lbs size large (maybe a tad loose but not bad) very thin though. Nike makes a version 2.0 to this shirt that has some cotton rather than 100% poly that I like better but still love this shirt.",,,,,,,
"really low quality material for this shirt I was expecting something way better for the price and the Nike brand although Im doubting if its actually legit. The Nike logo isnt reflective neither the ""Dri-Fit"" something I found weird because if you look closely to the other shirts they say NikeFit. My chest is quite visble with this tshirt something that Im not a fan though and I used and sweated it and it doesnt dry as my other Nike or whatever other sport brand tshirt. Sadly Im not in the US otherwise Id ask for a refund.

This review isnt biased. Nobody is paying to talk about the crappy product I bought is just a customers opinion about a con over a ""Nike"" shirt. Sad

Here are some pictures of the product.",,,,,,,
"I bought this shirt b/c I wanted a long sleeve shirt to wear around the house that wasnt too warm. This works perfectly. Its light, cool, and extremely comfortable.

Regarding the size, Im 60 and weight 230. I tend to buy XXL size shirts, but on the suggestion of other reviews, I ordered an XL. The fit is perfect, which is to say that any purchasers should also consider ordering a size smaller than normal.",,,,,,,
"The fabric is thin but nice, its overall a good looking shirt, but I have to return it since it was far too large. I normally order medium (I am 5 10.5), but I ordered small (which is the smallest size available) based on the reviews. Both the shirt and the sleeves are about 1 longer than the maximum that I would tolerate. There is also a lot of extra fabric under the armpits and the shirt fits pretty loosely, so I would just order 1-2 sizes smaller if that was possible. The shirt label says ""S"", so I was sent the correct size.",,,,,,,
Very cheap shirt, not like the photo what so ever. Im not sure why so much good reviews but its the only reason I thought i was getting a nice shirt which is cheap looking shirt, the only reason for the two starts is the super fast shipping!! Not worth the money! Believe me....,,,,,
"Great shirt. Love the material and feel. I usually get a large, but purchased med because of reviews. Fits good but I like shirts to be a little more loose. Going to order a couple more but large this time. Im 510, 180.

11-16-15 I ordered 2 more. I am LE and wear under my uniform. Hold up well and very comfortable.",,,,,,,
"I bought these shirts in 2014 and my initial response to these shirts was they were fantastic. All the seams l lie flat inside and out. Fit was good felt great on so long as I only wore them short term. So for fit and quality of manufacture they would get 5 stars, but this is 2016 and I believe there are some other considerations and technologies that should be added to this type of shirt. I used these shirts as I worked maintenance for a condo and later as a pest control technician.

Having anti-odor/Anti-microbial technology made into the shirt didnt seem that important when I bought these items. However, it has to be if you need to wear a shirt made with this type of fabric longer than a few hours. When I wore these shirts under my short sleeve work shirt they became foul smelling on long hot days. I thought it might be me forgetting deodorant or something, I even carried a spare stick in my truck. After I switched to another brand with anti-odor/Anti-microbial properties I didnt have the odor issues I had with the Nike Dry Fit. So this consideration is rated by me a critical fail.

Additionally these are not advertised as having any sun protection capability, another component I need here in NW Florida. I now wear this type of shirt to play tennis to try to stay cool in the summer and get some protection from the sun to make my dermatologist happy. I want to avoid sunscreen so it doesnt mess up my grip on the racquet. After wearing these shirts for nearly a year my dermatologist treated and area in the middle of my back. Hence my renewed interest in UPF shirts. Again this area is rated by me as a critical fail.

Bottom Line: Just dont, I have to replace these Nike Dry Fit shirts to get the anti-odor/Anti-microbial and UPF 50 capabilities available in other shirts so I wasted my money on Nike. Im trying the Vapor Apparel Mens UPF Long Sleeve Solar Performance T-Shirt as a replacement.",,,,,,,
The Nike Mens Legend Poly Long Sleeve Dri-Fit T-shirt arrived within the scheduled time frame and was exactly as described on the site. It fits well, is very comfortable and I would recommend it to anyone that either works out or, wants to wear it as a long sleeved shirt under a short sleeved shirt.,,,,,
The sleeves are so long. Im 60. 165lbs. I wear an XL. The sleeves hang past my hands about 3-4 inches.,,,,,,,
"I bought this shirt from another site since it was a lot cheaper.

The shirt definitely runs large. Im 510"", 170 lbs, and usually wear mediums for Nike shirts, and they arent too loose on me. I bought a small of this shirt and it fits me very well, you could maybe even say its a little baggy, which is fine with me.

The shirt is thin, made to wear in the summer or for workouts, not the best to keep warm.

However, the shirt is very comfortable and its not too thin that you can see through it.",,,,,,,
This is a nice quality shirt, especially if you order the right size. I ordered it for my husband who is small in stature. He is 5ft. 7 and 150 pounds. I ordered a medium and it fits him very well. He loved the shirt so much that I ordered another one in Maroon. Unfortunately, they sent me the red which is why I only gave four stars as opposed to five. The only reason why I didnt send it back is because my husband decided to go ahead and keep the red even though that is not the color I wanted.,,,,,
Very nice fit and feel.Well made. Its a kind of a semi-mesh fabric that looks to be breathable. Would buy another one anytime soon. Im pleased with my purchase.,,,,,,,
"The picture of the product shows a Nike check.
Be aware the shirt may not have a Nike check.
As seen below, mine did not.",,,,,,,
